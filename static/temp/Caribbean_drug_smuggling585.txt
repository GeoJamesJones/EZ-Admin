One woman made a trip to the Caribbean under the guise of a holiday to bring back cocaine in her suitcase, a jury was told. The 3,500 cost of the trip taken by defendant Jordane Morris and a friend was paid by the gang, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Eight people have gone on trial accused of bringing heroin and cocaine to Plymouth, mainly from London and the West Midlands. Dealers then used taxi trips  more than 700 in four months  to take the drugs around Plymouth. Some of the gang members continued to deal drugs even after police raids, prosecutors say.

 Mr Sapiecha said most of the heroin and cocaine was thought to come from London and the West Midlands. But he added that the gang also sent Morris to Jamaica to buy quarter of a kilo of cocaine in August 2017. She flew to the Caribbean from Birmingham Airport for two weeks with a friend. Mr Sapiecha said that she was driven home towards Plymouth by Campbell.

 The barrister said that they found a tenancy agreement in the defendants name hidden under the carpet for a property in Greenbank Avenue. The court heard police found 13 wraps of high-grade cocaine hidden in a microwave at the latter address. Mr Sapiecha said that motor scooter appeared to stop at the scene of one of the searches before driving away. Police traced the registration number to Thomas and searched his then home at St Leonards Road in Prince Rock  a home he shared with Doukoure.

 Mr Sapiecha said officers found crack cocaine and heroin plus 7,000 in cash in what was thought to be Doukoures bedroom. He added more than 2,000 was found in Thomass bedroom. The trial, expected to take four to five weeks, continues. Freeman and Doukoure have denied three charges relating to Class A drugs. They allegedly conspired to supply cocaine and heroin through 2017. Freeman, of Leytonstone, London, and Doukoure, of Hyde Park Road, Mutley, are finally charged with smuggling cocaine into the country between April and September that year.
