WOG is a corporation that operates a national chain of gasoline stations and convenience stores in Ukraine. The firm is based from Lutsk, Ukraine. It is a leading brand of gas station in Ukraine, and it was first national gas station network in the country.[3]

Overview[edit]
Beside the convenience store, the station also has a small restaurant-cafe Restorio. Each station also provides such additional services like car wash, air pump for tire inflation, Wi-Fi and telephone services, as well as adequate parking and restrooms.
The company has its own loyalty program called Praid (an adaptation of Pride). It partners with vehicle insurance companies VUSO and AKhA. WOG also has its own brand of fuel called MUSTANG. In the store visiting drivers may find vehicle service products branded as WOG such as engine oil, windshield wash, brake fluid and many others.
Some of stations are used by Western Union for money transfer such as one near city of Horodok in Lviv Oblast.[4]
In the beginning of 2013 WOG established its first floating fuel filling station in Sevastopol.[5] During the Ukrainian crisis, WOG did not initially plan on closing its locations in Russian-annexed Crimea and rebel-occupied territories in Donetsk and Luhansk.[6] However, WOG eventually put 22 stations in Crimea up for sale.[7]
