Storms stretch from around Baltimore through Annapolis and then south through Calvert County and northern St. Marys County. All of this activity will push east-northeast over the Chesapeake Bay in the next hour or so. For the most part, the storms were short-lived and pretty run-of-the-mill, but there were some reports of spotty tree damage, mainly west and well north of the Beltway. For most of the immediate area, the storm threat is over and cooler, drier air is on the way as skies gradually clear overnight. Scroll down for the forecast through tonight into tomorrow. Unless any new inclement weather develops, this will be the last update in this post.   After the rain.

Theyre now along the eastern branch of the Beltway and to the south through southern Prince Georges and Charles counties. The most intense storms are south of La Plata in Charles County and this activity is pushing toward Calvert County. We do have a few stragglers lingering to the northwest around Gaithersburg and Germantown, although those should quickly push off to the northeast into Howard and Baltimore counties over the next 30 to 45 minutes. Were seeing some nice rainbows in the wake of these storms:   A brief rainbow appears over Washington, DC @capitalweather pic.twitter.com/4ZE8pJAxfP Chris Duncan (@CTDPIX) June 13, 2019     Equally sunny and a nice Rainbow in Leesburg. @capitalweather @TownofLeesburg pic.twitter.com/5iDWqDLdkL Rabindra Samal (@rabindrasamal) June 13, 2019   5:30 p.m.  Storms pushing into immediate Washington area, strongest north and south The severe thunderstorm warning for Fairfax County has been discontinued as that particular storm has weakened. Radar now shows storms, stretching along a line from central Carroll County in northern Maryland and extending south to just east of Fredericksburg, quickly progressing eastward. The storms are moving inside the Beltway and headed into the District over the next 15 to 30 minutes, but are most intense to the north and south. Storm warnings for damaging winds and some small hail are in effect along the Interstate 70 corridor between Frederick and Baltimore and south of Alexandria and just east of Interstate 95 in Northern Virginia, extending into western Charles County in Southern Maryland through between 5:45 and 6:15 p.m.   Severe Thunderstorm Warning including Frederick MD, Eldersburg MD, Damascus MD until 6:00 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/S4pRcXpSIU NWS Severe Tstorm (@NWSSevereTstorm) June 13, 2019     Severe Thunderstorm Warning including Clinton MD, Bensville MD, Rosaryville MD until 6:00 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/05XXPxyKpI NWS Severe Tstorm (@NWSSevereTstorm) June 13, 2019   4:55 p.m.  Storms, some severe, moving into D.C.'s western suburbs. Warning for Manassas and central and northern Fairfax County Radar shows a broken line of storms stretching from near Frederick, Md. south through parts eastern Loudoun, western Fairfax, Prince William, southern Fauquier and western Stafford counties. A few storms embedded within this line are intense. A severe thunderstorm warning is in effect until 5:30 p.m. for the storm currently near Manassas moving east-northeast toward central Fairfax County right along Interstate 66. Centreville and Oakton are in the path of this storm which should arrive near the western edge of the Beltway by around 5:30 p.m. The storm may produce some isolated damaging wind gusts over 50 mph and small hail, in addition to heavy rain and lightning. These storms should arrive in the District just before 6 p.m. and exit our eastern suburbs after 7 p.m.   Severe Thunderstorm Warning including Centreville VA, Reston VA, Burke VA until 5:30 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/V7a4AYXEI7 NWS Severe Tstorm (@NWSSevereTstorm) June 13, 2019   Original post from 4 p.m. Sunshine was slow to develop across the region today, but we got enough of it this afternoon to boost temperatures into the 70s. That extra warming has also been enough to make some showers and storms boisterous as they enter the area. Well see some strong to potentially isolated severe weather move through the region over the next several hours, from west to east. It all ends later this evening ahead of a cool and breezy overnight. Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options    Through tonight: Showers and storms will move through the area, into early evening. The focus will be well west, about 4 to 5 p.m., and far east, around 7 to 8 p.m. Some storms could contain hail and isolated damaging winds. Skies will trend clearer overnight, with sometimes gusty winds blowing out of the northwest. Lows will settle across the 50s. View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Friday): Friday will feel more like mid-spring than the start of summer. The main downside will be a northwest wind, with steady blows as high as 20 mph or so. Gusts could approach 40 mph. Under largely sunny skies and with temperatures in the mid- and upper 70s, there shouldnt be too many complaints. See David Streits forecast through the weekend.
