    U.S. authorities seized more than $1 billion worth of cocaine Tuesday from a ship at a Philadelphia port, calling it one of the largest drug busts in American history. (June 18)
    APCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREEditor's note: We are committed to rigorously reporting not only social problems, but also potential solutions. Read more about our solutions journalism efforts and check out our workhere.As the United States nears 50 years of fighting the war on drugs, a number of statistics have had researchers questioning the effectiveness of federal efforts to stem the flow of illegal narcotics  particularly cocaine  into the country.Deaths from cocaine are on the rise and ranked second or third among illicit drug-related deaths from 2010-2016, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The United States leads all other countries in cocaine consumption. From 2010 to 2015, the White House estimated cocaine production increased by hundreds of tons in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the three primary producers of the drug, despite an average of $5 billion being dedicated annually to combating drug cartels.Now a new study led by University of Alabama geography professor Nick Magliocca has found the very efforts intended to hamstring cocaine trafficking may have beencausing it to spread.We were simply trying to test the premise that, the reason why narco-trafficking through Central America is so pervasive and resilientis not because interdiction is ineffective, which it is, but rather the current state of narco-trafficking is a direct result of interdiction, Magliocca said.To accomplish that, Magliocca and researchers from across the country developed NarcoLogic, a first-of-its-kind model that shows the known movements of traffickers throughout Central America between 2000-2014 and their responses to known disruptions of the supply chain.The model proved that anti-trafficking efforts resulted in a cockroach effect  essentially fracturing large cartels into smaller operations that continue smuggling via alternate routes. Between 1996 and 2017, the area utilized for drug trafficking more than tripled from 2 million sq. miles to 7 million sq. miles.Its very easy to make adjustments over a large area, and the transit area has only grown over time, Magliocca said.Spanish customs officers check a pack of cocaine in the port of Vigo after seizing the vessel Gure Leire carrying 2500 kg of cocaine, on June 3, 2019.

The next step for the researchers is to use the model as a virtual lab to testnew interdiction approaches andsee what practices would more effectively stop the influx of cocaine into the country.Wholesale cocaine prices in the United States have actually dropped significantly since 1980, deaths from cocaine overdose are rising and counterdrug forces intercept cocaine shipments at a low rate. More cocaine entered the United States in 2015 than in any other year, said Oregon State University professor David Wrathall in a news release. And one thing people who support interdiction and those who dont can agree on is that change is needed. This model can help determine what that change should look like.U.S. efforts to quash cocaine trafficking have not been completely ineffective.Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon Universitys Heinz College, has studied illegal drug trafficking as a supply-chain system since the 1980s, when cocaine was primarily run across the Caribbean Sea to Miami and South Florida.Caulkins said the price of cocaine alone is evidence that anti-trafficking efforts affectthe market.For instance,a 2.2-pound (1 kilogram) package can be shipped from Bogota, Colombia, to Montgomery for between $150-200, a UPS price calculator estimates. ButCaulkins said it costs the illegal drug supply chain more than $10,000 to move a kilogram of cocaine from Colombia to Alabama.Interdiction efforts succeed in putting a tax on it and making it more expensive than it should be, Caulkins said. Interdiction gets important credit for why its so expensive. And there are clear instances of interdiction relocating drug flow.A graph of cocaine seizures in 2015.(Photo: White House)Caulkins credited counterdrug operations for shifting the primaryflow of cocaine from the Caribbean to Central America.In 1982, President Ronald Reagan ordered the formation of the South Florida Task Force. By the late 1980s, Reagan reported the task force had seized $3 billion in drugs, andthe crackdown caused smuggling operations to pivot towardCentral America,a victory for the task force but also exactly the type of cockroach effect that can now be seen in the NarcoLogic model.Markets are adaptable, Caulkins said.The drugs themselves are just crazy compact and very high value-to-weight ratio. If I was trying to prevent you from smuggling concrete, the good news is, to move great amounts of concrete, youd need very big trucks. But drugs are very compact.Since 2005, cocaine has primarily come to the U.S. through Central America and the 2,000-mile Mexican-American border, where an estimated 14,000 trucks pass through 43 legal checkpoints a day, according to a 2014 National Defense University study Measuring Success in the War on Drugs.The U.S.allocated $4.6 billion to interdiction in 2016. A 2010 report from The Associated Press found the U.S. had spent more than $1 trillion on the war on drugs since it began in 1971.Graph of cocaine production, seizures and consumption in 2015.(Photo: White House)And there are myriadconsequences of illegal drug trade continuing unabated. Presence of drug trafficking organizations is often linked to higher rates of violence. In April, Mexico's murder rate was up nearly 10% from the2018 rate, according to media reports. The state with the highest murder rate,Guanajuato, also happens to be a known battleground for drug cartelsJalisco New Generation and Santa Rosa de Lima.Drug trafficking has also been linked to deforestation in parts of Central America, and when accounting for the cost of addiction, treatment,legal prosecution and incarceration, the costs beginto pile up on this side of the border.The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates the war on drugs' economic burden on the U.S. to be $78.5 billion a year.As Caulkins said, it's impossible to expect interdiction methods to completely snuff out the supply of  and the demand for  illegal drugs. The question is if current methods are cost effective and if resources could be used differently to combat trafficking.From 2005-2010, the U.S. saw the largest decline in an illegal market in U.S. history. Cocaine production from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia plummeted. Violence in Mexico made the supply chain more volatile and less consistent. But there are a hostof other factors and none are persuasive individually, Caulkins said.Spanish customs officers check a pack of cocaine in the port of Vigo after seizing the vessel Gure Leire carrying 2500 kg of cocaine, on June 3, 2019. (Photo by MIGUEL RIOPA / AFP)        (Photo credit should read MIGUEL RIOPA/AFP/Getty Images)(Photo: MIGUEL RIOPA, AFP/Getty Images)Caulkins said studies like Magliocca's are important if a different outcome is to be expected.I believe that the investment the country makes in scientific study of the supply side of drug issues is small compared to how important these issues are, Caulkins said.The U.S. spends more on supply control but most of the research is on the demand side and things like developing better treatments. Theres nothing wrong (with that) but if you dont understand the thing youre trying to defeat, youre not going to be very effective.With the NarcoLogic model, Magliocca and his peers hope to create a virtual lab that will allow study of past interdiction methods and testing of new ones.You can create multiple possible worlds and explore scenarios that range from the perfect optimal solutions If you had unlimited resources, where would you put them and how would that affect trafficking?  to the other extreme. If you had a stand down in Central America, what would that mean? Magliocca said. Were talking to people who know a lot about interdiction and putting their input into the models as to how its actually done.We're looking at the full range of possible solutions.News tips?
