Hpital Universitaire de Mirebalais










 





		Were thrilled that Hpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, in Mirebalais, Haiti, is open. The 205,000-square foot, 300-bed facilitycalled University Hospital for shortis filling a huge void, locally and nationally, for people who previously had limited access to quality health care.


			This hospital is the culmination of a dream dating back a quarter-century and underlines our commitment to the country and people of Haiti, which is stronger than ever after the earthquake.Paul Farmer
			Co-founder, Partners In Health


		The hospital provides primary care services to about 185,000 people in Mirebalais and two nearby communities. But patients from a much wider areaall of central Haiti and areas in and around Port-au-Princecan also receive secondary and tertiary care. We see as many as 700 patients every day in our ambulatory clinics. Learn more here.

		And at a time when Haiti desperately needs skilled professionals, University Hospitalprovides high-quality education for the next generation of Haitian nurses, medical students, and resident physicians.

		Thanks to incredibly generous supporters, we have raised funds to design, build, and outfit the hospital and residences, and we will continue to rely on our friends and supporters who believe we canand shouldprovide health care to people everywhere, and especially to people living on the margin of extreme poverty.
