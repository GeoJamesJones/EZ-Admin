About GEO
GEO is a set of free interactive databases and tools
  built collaboratively by people like you
GOAL: to promote an understanding, on a global
  scale, of the dynamics of change in energy systems, quantify
  emissions and their impacts, and accelerate the transition to
  carbon-neutral, environmentally benign energy systems while
  providing affordable energy to all. 
By providing easy to use and visualize data, models and analysis
  tools we aim to engage the public and the experts. 
Data in GEO can be edited from anywhere in the world.
We invite collaborations to help build GEO.
