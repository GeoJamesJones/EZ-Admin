Central Germany is home to mid-size cities including Kassel, Erfurt and the resort town of Bad Hersfeld. Erfurt has a population of about 200,000 and is the capital of the state of Thuringia. Some of Germanys densest population concentrationsincluding Dortmund, the cities of the Ruhr and Hanoverare within a 120-mile radius of Central Germany.
A robust autobahn and highway network provides quick access from Central Germany to the entire country. The Kassel region sits at an intersection of the major national east-west and north-south highways. Freight and passenger railroads that cross Germany from east to west and from north to south also run through Central Germany. Erfurts freight rail transportation center is a key node on the planned Trans-European Network. As a result, Central Germany is well positioned to house industrial property and logistics facilities, such as national distribution centers.
Prologis operates industrial properties and warehouses in Central Germany.
