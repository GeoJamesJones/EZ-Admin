They split up responsibilities to execute the murder using knives, machetes and guns.

The victim drove up with another passenger in the car and was asked to take the MS-13 member to a location in Annapolis Neck Road.Once the arrived another gang member approached with a gun, and the MS-13 member in the cab also pointed a gun at the driver and passenger.Both men tried to run. One was shot in the leg and hacked with a machete.
