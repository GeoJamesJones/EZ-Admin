Most storms should exit the region or dissipate by sunset. This is the last update in this post. See our PM Update for the full forecast through Sunday. 5:20 p.m. - Storms, some severe, south and east of Washington Two zones of storms in the region have prompted severe thunderstorm warnings. The first is between Bowie and Annapolis where there is a severe thunderstorm warning until 6 p.m. Storms in this area may produce damaging wind gusts and small hail, in addition to heavy rain and lightning. A second area of storms is from Dale City and to the southeast. This area of storminess will push through Charles County through 6 p.m., where there is also a severe thunderstorm warning in effect. Once these storms exit, much of the region should catch a breather from storms, although we wont be able to totally rule out an isolated storm or two popping up through sunset or so. 4:13 p.m. - Severe thunderstorm warnings for eastern Montgomery, Howard, and southern Prince Georges counties until 5:00 p.m. The main line of storms has mostly remained north of the Washington area but a couple intense thunderstorm cells have popped up in the immediate area. One cell is moving southeast through eastern Montgomery and Howard county. This storm could affect the area east of Olney by around 4:30-4:45 p.m. Columbia is in the path of this storm around 5 p.m., or a little before   Severe Thunderstorm Warning including Columbia MD, Ellicott City MD, Scaggsville MD until 5:00 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/9eRcMIRGXZ NWS Severe Tstorm (@NWSSevereTstorm) June 29, 2019   A second strong cell, also under a warning, is approaching Fort Washington in southern Prince Georges County and is pointed toward Brandywine and Waldorf in the next 45 minutes.   Severe Thunderstorm Warning including Alexandria VA, Waldorf MD, Clinton MD until 5:00 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/ecsmDWgXfE NWS Severe Tstorm (@NWSSevereTstorm) June 29, 2019   In addition to lightning and heavy rain, pockets of strong to damaging winds and small hail are possible in these cells. As the storm passed through the area between Huntington and Mt. Vernon, we received multiple reports of mostly small hail but some stones up to the size of quarters:   Ten solid minutes of hail in Alexandria, 3 miles south of the beltway. Some as large as a quarter. @capitalweather pic.twitter.com/5TA8i49XH4 Laura Marshall (@freewilma) June 29, 2019   Original post from mid-afternoon Its hot and super muggy, and these conditions could fuel storms approaching from the west and northwest into the evening. A severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for the region through 7 p.m. Storms could produce damaging wind gusts in addition to torrential rain and frequent lightning. A few storms could also produce some hail (5 percent chance).   A severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of DE, DC, MD, VA, WV until 7 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/2kLGEdfCaH NWS Severe Tstorm (@NWSSevereTstorm) June 29, 2019   Remember a watch means conditions are favorable for storms, but not a guarantee theyll affect your location. However, if a severe thunderstorm warning is issued for your area, it means a dangerous storm is imminent and you should seek shelter. As of the middle of the afternoon, a cluster of strong thunderstorms had developed along a cold front in central Pennsylvania. The storms were moving toward the southeast, and there is some concern these storms could continue to propagate into the very unstable air mass located over the D.C. region, north central and northeastern Maryland. The timing for this line of storms, if it makes into the Washington region, would be between 4 and 7 p.m. from northwest to southeast. However, there is some chance these storms mainly remain in northern Maryland and are more of a threat north and northeast of Interstate 70 from Frederick to Baltimore. Ahead of this line, scattered storms were popping up, mainly along and east of Interstate 95. Isolated storms have become severe with small pockets of damaging wind gusts (or microbursts). We will update this post if organized severe storms threaten the Washington region.
