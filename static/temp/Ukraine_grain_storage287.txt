This report contains revised production and trade forecasts for MY2018/2019, as well as updated trade estimates for MY2017/2018. Ukraine is expected to remain an important exporter in the Black Sea Region for MY2018/2019. The grain production regions have been slightly affected by adverse weather conditions during the 2018 spring and summer months. Current in-land logistics issues are not likely to affect the total volume of grain exports for MY2018/2019.
