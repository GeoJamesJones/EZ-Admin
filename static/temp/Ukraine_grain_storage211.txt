WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.  In 2018 Ukraine harvested a record 35 million tonnes of corn, a 50% increase over the previous year, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agricultures Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS).
Because of the significant production increase, the domestic price of corn has plummeted and exports for 2018-19 are expected to increase.
The FAS said it has heard from sources that 5% of the corn area may not have been harvested because there were no storage silos available.
Corn will remain popular as a feed crop given the lower price. Lower prices will lead to a decreased corn area in 2019, the FAS said.
Imports are estimated to be 12% higher than the USDAs official data for 2018-19 based on the deceased corn area.
