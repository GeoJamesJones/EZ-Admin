Journal of Electrical Engineeringwww.jee.ro EVALUATING THE ENERGY SYSTEM IN YEMEN  Maged M. AL-BARASHI1, Doaa K. IBRAHIM2, and Essam El-Din ABO EL-ZAHAB2  1 Department of Electricity, Technical Industrial Institute, Dhamar, Yemen  2 Electrical Power and Machines Dept., Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Egypt  Correspondence Author Email: eng.albarashi@gmail.com  Abstract:  This  paper  presents  a  deep  analysis  for  the energy system in Yemen, which consists of thermal power plants taking into  account the strengths  and weaknesses of its power system. The investigation  results show   that Yemen power  system suffers  lacking of energy  efficiency (EE),  weak  institutional  capacity,  high  losses  in  the generation,  transmission  and  distribution  grids,  and currently  the  disability  to  invest  in  renewable  energy (RE). Yemen  should  focus  on foundational  activities  to build  institutional  capacity  and  mobilize  resources  to initiate suitable  energy efficiency  policies and  measures. Yemen should also focus on exploring the opportunities of designing  innovative  energy  systems  based  on decentralized  small-scale  power  generation. Microgrids could enable power supply to remote areas at lower costs than required by traditional infrastructure.  Key words: energy efficiency,  renewable energy,  Yemen Power System, Al-Mukha wind farm.  1. Energy Sector in Yemen.   The Yemeni energy sector consists of oil, natural gas,  and biofuels.  Energy  production in  2012 was 15,109 kilotonne of  oil equivalent  (ktoe) while the consumption  was  6,923  ktoe.  Figure  1  shows  the share of total primary energy supply in 2012 [1, 2]. In 2013, Yemen generated 5,600 GWh of electricity; 2,879 GWh from oil (steam and diesel power plants) and  2,722  GWh  from  gas,  and  consumed  4,976 GWh  (consumption  is  currently  not  actually estimated because of the political situations) [3].  Fig. 1.  Share of total primary energy supply in 2012 [2]  2. Ownership and Role of Government   The electricity sector in Yemen is fully managed by  the  Ministry  of  Electricity  and  Energy.  The Public Electricity Company (PEC), which  accounts for 80% of the generation capacity of the country, is 100%  state-owned  company.  Supplying  the  rural areas  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Public Authority  of  Rural  Electrification.  The  main institution  responsible  for  developing  renewable energy policy is the General Department for RE of the Ministry of Electricity and Energy [4, 5].   3. Characteristics of Yemen Power System.   Electricity  in  Yemen  mainly  depends  on  oil power plants; 699  MW from diesel, 495 MW from steam,  and  341  MW  from  gas  power  plants. The total capacity of the national grid in 2013 was 1,535 MW [3]. The power plants generate electrical power at different voltage levels which are 10.5 kV, 11 kV, 13.8 kV, and 15 kV and then the voltage levels are boosted  to the  transmission voltages  levels  of 230 kV and 400 kV. The medium voltage level of 33 kV is  used  to  transmit  the  electricity  from  the substations to the demand locations. The distribution network uses the 11 kV to transmit the electricity to the distribution transformers. The nominal frequency for the grid is 50Hz. Figure 2 shows the single line diagram of Yemeni transmission grid with all power stations and substations [6].      Electricity  tariff  ranges  from  4  Rial/kWh  for urban households consumption to  30 Rial/kWh  for government  consumption.  These  prices  are subsidized,  which  is  a  heavy  burden  for  the deployment of RE technologies [7], so it is expected to be increased.      Yemen&aposs  population  has  the  worst  access  to electricity in the region, with only 52% are supplied and  electricity  of  331  kWh/capita  [3].  The  main network  of  Yemen  connects  the  urban  areas  and main  cities.  What  remains  is  assessed  to  get electricity for few hours per day from other sources, typically  a  diesel  generator,  or  the  use  of  PEC-managed  local  mini-grids  and  of  independent neighborhood mini-grids.      The  connected  consumers  to  the  network  also suffer  interruptions  of  electricity,  with  frequent blackouts  because  of  the  old,  inefficient infrastructure  of  generation,  and  transmission  and distribution,  technical  failures,  sabotage,  and repeated shortages in  fuel, especially diesel fuel, in power stations. Oil;  88.7 % Natural gas;  9.8 % Biofuels/waste; 1.5 % 1




Journal of Electrical Engineeringwww.jee.ro   Fig. 2: Single line diagram of transmission network [6]       Yemen has  a lagging  grade in  accordance with Arab  Future  Energy  Index  (AFEX)  Energy Efficiency  [8].  It  lacks  EE  policies,  has  weak institutional  capacity,  and  has  high  losses  in  the generation, transmission and distribution of power. However,  Yemen  has  an  average  grade  in accordance  with  AFEX  Renewable  Energy  [9].  It faces  the challenge  of  delivering  electricity  to the largest part of the population. Diesel is largely used to generate electricity and pump water. In 2014, the Government of Yemen (GOY) has largely increased diesel fuel prices, leading to tension and frustration in  the  community. Switching  from  diesel  to solar energy can help enhancing peoples lives. Due to the deteriorating political situation, Yemen is no longer able  to  progress  in  attracting  investments  in  RE. Figure 3  and Figure 4 show the ranking of Yemen according to AFEX.      GOY is aggressively promoting RE and EE in the country.  In  2009,  GOY  approved  the  national strategy for RE and EE, which aims to increase 15% of  EE  in  the  power  sector  by  2025.  EE  strategy includes  providing  230  GWh/year  through  solar water  heaters  (SWH), 460  GWh/year by  replacing economic lamps and electrification of 110,000 rural homes from the public network and 20,000 by solar photovoltaic  (PV)  off-grid  installations  [1,  10]. Multiple RE sources have been  investigated in the strategy and action plan for RE. Figure 5 shows the targeted  RE  generation  with  share  of  15%  of electricity generation by 2025 [1, 10].  4. Renewable Energy in Yemen       People  now know  that oil  is no  longer reliable source of energy since it is not available because the situation  is not  stable, so  the  RE (solar  energy in particular) is largely being considered by  Yemenis. Figure 6 shows the solar and wind map of Yemen. Many people have resorted to PV as an emergency source for  the household appliances.  However, the overall size of the  implementation of solar projects is  only 3  MW in  2012 (0.075%)  which is  a small fraction  [10].  For  wind,  GOY  decided  to  build  a wind farm with a  target capacity of  60 MW  at Al-Mukha in 2016 to demonstrate the financial viability of wind power.     In  [11],  the  modeling  and  impact  analysis  of integrating  Al-Mukha  wind  farm  to  the  Yemen power  system  have  been  performed  using  the DIgSILENT  program.  The  studies  of  load  flow showed that  the loading  of most  lines and  voltage variations  are  slightly  changed.  Under  the contingency situations,  there is  a thermal overload issue of the overhead lines. Additional findings from the transient stability studies indicate that this wind farm will not weaken the system transient stability.

Journal of Electrical Engineeringwww.jee.ro The  low-voltage  ride-through  study  showed  that after the fault is cleared, the wind turbine generators recovered their  voltage level almost to  its pre-fault voltage  value.  It  is found  that  the  proposed wind farm contributed voltage and current total harmonic distortions  higher  than  the  permissible  limits specified  in  the  standards.  This  would  require  a harmonic filter to be installed in order to mitigate the harmonics. As for the flicker, the resulting levels are far below any critical values so it can  be assumed that flicker will not cause any problem in the studied case.

Conclusions and Recommendations   Deep analysis of the power system of Yemen has been performed. The paper showed that the current system  is  weak,  and  therefore  the  following recommendations are suggested:  The  country  needs  to  focus  on  selecting priorities,  energy  planning  and  mobilizing efforts as it begins introducing EE measures.  Switching  from  diesel  to  solar  energy  can help people improve their living conditions.  Yemen  should  focus  on  exploring  the opportunities for innovative energy systems design  based  on  decentralized  power generation.  Microgrids could be able to supply power in remote areas at lower costs than traditional infrastructure required.  References 1.

Results show that the two main drivers for the convenience of such systems are the load profile and the PV power plant power sizing.

The latter shows that the correct sizing of the PV powerplant allows for a smarter use of the battery and gives lesser dependence on the energy exchanged with the grid.Read moreBookMicrogrid: Advanced Control Methods and Renewable Energy System IntegrationOctober 2016M.S.
