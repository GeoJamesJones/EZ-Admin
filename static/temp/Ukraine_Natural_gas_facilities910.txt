 Map of the natural gas transmission system of Ukraine
The natural gas transmission system of Ukraine is a complex of natural gas transmission pipelines for gas import and transit in Ukraine. It is one of the largest gas transmission systems in the world.[1] The system is linked with natural gas transmission systems of Russia and Belarus on one hand, and with systems of Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary and Slovakia on other hand.[2] The system is owned by Government of Ukraine and operated by Ukrtransgaz.[3] Some local transmission lines together with distribution sets are owned by regional gas companies.[3]

History[edit]
The development of Ukrainian gas pipeline system started in Galicia, then part of Poland.[4] The first gas pipeline was BoryslavDrohobych pipeline in 1912. In 1924, after discovery of the Dashava gas field the DashavaStryiDrohobych gas pipeline was constructed.[5] In 1928, the DashavaLviv and in 1937, the DashavaTarnw pipelines were built. After Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, the DashavaTarnw pipeline became the first cross-border pipeline of the Soviet Union.[4] the OporyBoryslav and OporyLviv pipelines were built in 19401941.[6]
The current Ukrainian transmission system was built as an integrated part of the unified gas supply system of the former Soviet Union. In 19401960s, it was mainly built to use the Galician gas in other regions of the Soviet Union.[6] In 1948, the DashavaKyiv pipeline which was the largest pipeline that time in Europe, was launched.[5] In 1951, DashavaKyiv pipeline was prolonged to Bryansk and Moscow. In 1955, construction of the DashavaMinsk pipeline started, which later was prolonged to Vilnius and Riga.[6] It was completed in 1960.[5] After discovery of the Shebelinka gas field in 1956, the ShebelinkaKharkiv pipeline and the ShebelinkaDnipropetrovskKryvyi RihOdessa pipeline with branches to Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv and Kherson were completed in 1966.[6][7] This southern corridor was prolonged to Moldova and later to Southeast Europe between 1974 and 1978.[7] The ShebelinkaKyiv pipeline with branches to Poltava and Kremenchuk was completed in 1969.[6][7] In 19701974, it was prolonged to the Western border.[7] Also the ShebelinkaBelgorodKurskBryansk pipelines was built.[6] In 1964, the first underground gas storage in Ukraine, the Olyshevske gas storage, was commissioned.[5]
In 19701980s, the Ukrainian gas transmission system was developed as a gas export route to Europe.[8] The first large-scale export pipeline, the DolynaUzhhorodWestern border pipeline, became operational in 1967. It was the first stage of the Bratstvo (Brotherhood) pipeline system.[6] In 1978, the Soyuz pipeline (OrenburgWestern border pipeline) was built as the first Soviet natural gas export pipeline. It followed by the UrengoyPomaryUzhhorod pipeline in 1983 (now also named as Bratstvo or Brotherhood pipeline) and the Progress pipeline (YamburgWestern border pipeline) in 1988. Between 1986 and 2001, the YeletsKremenchukAnanyivTiraspolIzmail rote was developed.[9]

Technical description[edit]
The natural gas transmission system of Ukraine consists of 38,550 kilometres (23,950mi) of pipelines, including 22,160 kilometres (13,770mi) of trunk pipelines and 16,390 kilometres (10,180mi) of branch pipelines.[10] In addition, the system includes 72compressor stations with 702 compressors, having a total capacity of 5,442.9MW, and 13underground gas storage facilities with an active storage capacity of 30.9billion cubic metres (1.09trillion cubic feet).[3][11] As of 2009, the system had import capacity of 288billion cubic metres (10.2trillion cubic feet) and export capacity of 178billion cubic metres (6.3trillion cubic feet) per year.[11]
Before 2012, gas entered to Ukraine only from entry points on borders with Russia and Belarus. Most of the gas transit went to Slovakia and further to other countries in Central and Western Europe. Smaller amount of natural gas was transported to Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Moldova.[8] In 20122014, some entry/exit points with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia were modified to allow also reverse gas flow from these countries to Ukraine.[12]
The value of the Ukrainian transmission system is estimated at US$925billion. In 2004, the Ukrainian Centre for Economic and Political Studies estimated its value at $1213 billion.[1]

Major pipelines[edit]
The gas transmission system of Ukraine could be divided into three transit corridors which are the western transit corridor, the southern transit corridor, and the northsouth internal corridor for Russian domestic gas transportation.[2]

Western corridor[edit]
Main pipelines of the western corridor, also known as the Bratstvo or Brotherhood pipeline system, are the Soyuz pipeline (OrenburgWestern border pipeline), the Progress pipeline (YamburgWestern border pipeline) and the UrengoyPomaryUzhhorod pipeline. In addition, it consist of the YeletsKurskDykanka pipeline, the KurskKyiv pipeline, the KyivWestern border pipeline, the KomarnoDrozdovychi pipeline, the IvatsevichyDolyna pipeline, the TorzhokSmolenskMazyrDolyna pipeline, the UzhhorodBerehove pipeline, the DolynaUzhhorod pipeline, and the KhustSatu Mare pipeline.[2][8]
The Soyuz pipeline, originating from the Orenburg gas field, enters to Ukraine east of Novopskov through the Sokhranovka gas metering station in Russia.[8] Up to Novopskov, it runs parallel to the OrenburgNovopskov pipeline. From there, the Soyuz pipeline runs westward until near Bar it joins the corridor of the UrengoyPomaryUzhhorod and Progress pipelines. It leaves Ukraine through the Uzhhorod gas metering and pumping station.[1] Length of the Ukrainian section of the Soyuz pipeline is 1,567 kilometres (974mi) and it has capacity of 26.1billion cubic metres (920billion cubic feet) per year.[11]
The Progress pipeline, originating from the Yamburg gas field, runs mostly parallel to the UrengoyPomaryUzhhorod pipeline. It enters to Ukraine north of Sumy through the Sudzha gas metering station in Russia and leaves through the Uzhhorod gas metering and pumping station.[1] The Ukrainian section has length of 1,120 kilometres (700mi) and it has capacity of 28.5billion cubic metres (1.01trillion cubic feet) per year.[11]
The UrengoyPomaryUzhhorod pipeline, originating from the Urengoy gas field, enters to Ukraine at the Sudzha gas metering station like Progress, the KurskKyiv and the YeletsKurskDykanka pipelines. In Ukraine, it takes gas through to the Uzhhorod gas metering and pumping station on the Ukrainian border with Slovakia.[8][1] Length of the Ukrainian section is 1,160 kilometres (720mi) and it has capacity of 29.7billion cubic metres (1.05trillion cubic feet) per year.[11]
The YeletsKurskDykanka and the KurskKyiv pipeline enter to Ukraine through the Sudzha gas metering station.[8] The TorzhokSmolenskMazyrDolyna pipeline enters Ukraine through the Mazyr gas metering station and the IvatsevichyDolyna pipeline enters through the Kobryn gas metering station, both in Belarus.[11][13] The KomarnoDrozdovychi pipeline enters to Poland through the Drozdovychi metering station, the UzhhorodBerehove pipeline enters to Hungary through the Berehove metering station, and the KhustSatu Mare pipeline enters to Romania through the Tekove metering station.[8]

Southern corridor[edit]
Main pipelines of the southern transit corridor are the YeletsKremenchukKryvyi Rih pipeline, the ShebelinkaDnipropetrovskKryvyi RihRozdilnaIzmail pipeline, the KremenchukAnanyivBohorodchany pipeline, the AnanyivTiraspolIzmail pipeline, and the RozdilnaIzmail pipeline.[2][8] The gas import pipelines are the OstrogozhskShebelinka pipeline, the UrengoyNovopskov pipeline, the PetrovskNovopskov pipeline, and the OrenburgNovopskov pipeline.[8]
The YeletsKremenchukKryvyi Rih pipeline enters into Ukraine through the Sudzha gas metering station. Length of the Ukrainian section of this pipeline is 323 kilometres (201mi) and it has capacity of 32billion cubic metres (1.1trillion cubic feet) per year. Length of the KremenchukAnanyivChernivtsiBohorodchany pipeline is 351 kilometres (218mi) and it has capacity of 30billion cubic metres (1.1trillion cubic feet) per year.[11] It enters to Moldova through the Hrebenyky gas metering station and the reverse flow enters through the Oleksiyivka gas metering station. The AnanyivTiraspolIzmail pipeline enters Moldova through the Hrebenyky gas metering station, and the ShebelinkaDnipropetrovskKryvyi RihIzmail and the RozdilnaIzmail pipelines enter through the Ryasnopil (Rozdilna) gas metering station.[14] After re-entering to Ukraine all three pipelines exit to Romania through the Orlivka gas metering and pumping station.[8][11] Length of the AnanyivTiraspolIzmail pipeline is 256 kilometres (159mi) and it has capacity of 23.7billion cubic metres (840billion cubic feet) per year.[11]
The OstrogozhskShebelinka pipeline enters to Ukraine through the Valuyki gas metering station, the OrenburgNovopskov pipelines enters through the Sokhranovka gas metering station, and the UrengoyNovopskov and the PetrovskNovopskov enter through the Pisarevka gas metering station, all in Russia.[8]
Crimea is connected to the main gas transportations system (ShebelinkaDnipropetrovskKryvyi RihRozdilnaIzmail pipeline) through the MarivkaKhersonCrimea pipeline. In Krasnoperekopsk Raion, Crimea, one branch runs to the Hlibivske storage facility, one branch runs to Dzhankoy, Feodosia and Kerch, and one branch runs to Simferopol and Sevastopol.[15]

Northsouth Russian domestic corridor[edit]
This corridor, crossing Luhansk Oblast in Eastern Ukraine, consist of the Southern CaucasusCentre pipeline system. Main pipelines of this corridor are the KrasnodarSerpukhov pipeline and the StavropolMoscow pipeline, entering to Ukraine through the Prokhorivka gas metering station in south and the Serebryanka gas metering station in north. After Russia built the SokhranovkaOktyabrskaya bypass and the PetrovskFrolovoIzobilnoye pipeline, this corridor through Ukraine is not in use.[2][16] However, during the Ukrainian crisis Russia used this corridor to supply Donbas regions not controlled by the Ukrainian Government through the Prokhorivka and Platovo gas metering stations.[17]

Underground gas storages[edit]
Ukraine has 12gas storage operated by Ukrtransgas. Five of these are located in Western Ukraine, two in Central Ukraine and five in Eastern Ukraine.[1] In addition one gas storage, the Hlibivske storage facility, operated by Chornomornaftogaz, is located in Crimea and currently is not controlled by Ukraine authorities.[3] The largest storage is BilcheVolytskoUgerske in Western Ukraine having more than half of the Ukrainian total storage capacity.[1]

Rehabilitation and modernization[edit]
In 2009, Ukraine, the European Commission, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank and the World Bank signed a joint declaration on the modernisation of the Ukrainian gas transmission System. The European Union financed the feasibility study which was conducted by Mott MacDonald.[3] According to the master plan of Ukrtransgas, the priority objects are Soyuz, Progress, UrengoyPomaryUzhhorod, YeletsKremenchukKryvyi Rih and AnanyivTiraspolIzmail pipelines, BilcheVolytskoUgerske and Bohorodchany underground gas storages, and Uzhhorod, Berehove, Drozdovychi, Tekove and Orlivka gas metering stations.[11] The priority investment programme requires US$3.2billion, $342million for storage and $2.85billion for pipelines and compressors.[3]
