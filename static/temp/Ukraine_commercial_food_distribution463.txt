(total market size = (total local production + imports) - exports)Data Sources:Total Local Production: http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/Total Exports: https://www.worldtradestatistics.com/gta/; http://sfs.gov.ua/ms/f11Total Imports: https://www.worldtradestatistics.com/gta/; http://sfs.gov.ua/ms/f11Imports from U.S.: https://www.worldtradestatistics.com/gta/In 2017, total processed food production in Ukraine was $17 billion making up 21 percent of the total industrial output. In trade terms, processed food exports reached $4.6 billion accounting for 25.7 percent of Ukraines agricultural products and processed food exports.Altogether, there are two thousand small, medium, and large food processing enterprises in Ukraine, 200 of which are partners of international companies. Global giants that are well established in Ukraine include Mondelez, Nestle, Danone, PepsiCo, CocaCola, Carlsberg, Jacobs, East Balt Bakery, and Wim-Bill-Dann. In 2017, capital investments made in food processing companies increased by $11.7 million compared to 2016 and amounted to $674.6 million or 13 percent of total industrial capital investments.While Ukraines food processing industry includes more than 40 different sectors ranging from cereal, to sugar, to alcohol, to canned vegetables, vegetable and animal oils and confectionerydominate the industry. Vegetable oil account for 25.1 percent of all Ukraines exports and the confectionery for nearly one percent of all Ukraines exports.Along with the vegetable oil and confectionery subsectors, there are significant opportunities in vegetable and fruit processing. For example, Ukraine is the leading producer of tomato paste in the former Soviet Union and an active competitor vis a vis European producers. Ukraine is also one of the five largest European suppliers of apple concentrate. Finally, Ukraines share of global potato production is 6.2 percent and the with its GMO-free potato, Ukraine is well positioned to develop a strong position in the potato flour and stash market and to increase the volume of potato exports to the EU.Given the obligatory implementation of HACCP by 2020 and new export markets such as China and Africa, major dairy companies are investing in milk production to control the full production chain from livestock breeding and milk processing to manufacturing and packaging.Large vertically integrated poultry producers, assisted by international financial institutions, will continue to expand and increase their market share. This growth will be driven by exports to the European Union (EU), Middle East, and Asia and harmonization with EU standards. The level of concentration in Ukraines meat processing sector is high, with the top 20 companies accounting for 10 percent of cattle livestock, 28 percent of pig livestock, and 58 percent of poultry livestock.U.S. food processing companies should consider the competitive landscape. Germany, Italy, Turley, the Netherlands, and Poland are the major exporters of food processing and packaging machinery and equipment. Italy and Germany exports account for 73 percent of the machinery used for confectionery. Spains share of sugar manufacturing machinery exports accounts for 40 percent. The Netherlands, Germany, and Polands share of poultry processing equipment is 81 percent. Italy and Netherlands together account for 33 percent of the equipment for bakery and macaroni production. Overall U.S. exports food processing machinery and remain very low compared to the European suppliers.The Commercial Service in Kyiv identified food processing equipment as a best prospect following the beginning of the implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) between Ukraine and the European Union (EU) in January 2016. This agreement includes the gradual removal of customs tariffs and quotas and the extensive harmonization of Ukraines laws, norms, and regulations in various sectors. Harmonization, in turn, will create an even greater competition for U.S. suppliers.U.S. suppliers need to consider that despite fierce competition from European suppliers, Ukraine growing the potential of agri-food chain development is very high as food processing companies will need to modernize their production. Harmonization of the Ukrainian food safety legislation in compliance with EU norms, the requirement to implement Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) by 2020, and expansion to foreign markets will increase demand for higher quality food processing and packaging materials.Regarding distribution, in Ukraine, it is easier for U.S. companies to sell equipment and machinery to local distributors rather than end-users. This is because distributors have local exposure, meaning they know who needs the products and most importantly, who can pay for it. Also, a local distributor may handle customs clearance, tax payments, and certification procedures, as well as service and maintenance. If a U.S. exporter is seriously interested in the Ukrainian market, they should consider opening a representative office here. This will broaden the scope of expected support functions (marketing, promotion, and other auxiliary functions), serve as a base from which to expand to neighboring countries, and allow the company to manage the demand for spare parts and repair services.

Opportunities
Despite the challenges listed above of a lack of financing for equipment purchases and a lack of highly qualified personnel, the Ukrainian food processing industry has many advantages. Most significantly, Ukraine has an abundance of domestic raw materials. Additionally, Ukraine may serve as an export base to both East and West. In 2015, the Government of Ukraine also made many notable reforms and structural adjustments that will positively impact food processing, including the progressive removal of customs tariffs and quotas and the extensive harmonization of laws in compliance with the DCFTA as discussed above. Together, these strengths are creating opportunities in oil production, vegetable processing (including oils), confectionary, dairy, and meat processing.
