 Ukrainian coin commemorating nuclear power
Ukraine operates four nuclear power plants with 15 reactors located in Volhynia and South Ukraine.[1] 
The total installed nuclear power capacity is over 13 GWe,[2] ranking seventh in the world in 2016.[1]
Energoatom, a Ukrainian state enterprise, operates all four active nuclear power stations in Ukraine.[3]
In 2014, nuclear power supplied 49.4% of Ukraine's electricity production of 168TWh.

Overview[edit]
 Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant is Europe's largest with six reactors whose total capacity is 6 GW[1]

Ukraine relies to a large extent on nuclear energy. 
The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is located in Ukraine. 
In 2006, the government planned to build 11 new reactors by the year 2030, which would almost double the current amount of nuclear power capacity.[4] 
Ukraine's power sector is the twelfth-largest in the world in terms of installed capacity, with 54gigawatts (GW).[5]
Renewable energy still plays a very modest role in electrical output; in 2005 energy production was met by the following sources: nuclear (47percent), thermal (45percent), hydroelectric and other (8percent).[4]

 Chernobyl AES
The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. 
An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive contamination into the atmosphere, which spread over much of Western USSR and Europe. 
It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster).[6] The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18billion rubles, crippling the Soviet economy.[7]
Ukraine used to receive its nuclear fuel exclusively from Russia by the Russian company TVEL. Since 2008 the country also gets nuclear fuel from Westinghouse.[8] 
Since 2014 Westinghouse's share of imports grew to more than 30% in 2016.[1] In 2018 Westinghouse's contract to supply VVER fuel was extended to 2025.[9] Oil and natural gas provide the remainder of the country's energy; these are also imported from the former Soviet Union.
In 2011 Energoatom began a project to bring safety into line with international standards at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, with a target completion date of 2017. In 2015 the completion date was put back to 2020, due to financing delays.[10] In 2015 some government agencies made corruption allegations against Energoatom, with concerns raised by Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.[11] In March 2016, Energoatom's assets and bank accounts were frozen by Ukrainian courts over allegedly unpaid debts; Energoatom appealed the decision, but the frozen finances led to contractual breaches.[12] In June 2016 its bank accounts were unfrozen.[13]
In February 2018 Ukraine secured $250 million of U.S. funding to build a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, which will avoid the need ship spent nuclear fuel to Russia.[14]
In March 2018 Energoatom stated that electricity prices were too low to cover the cost of new nuclear fuel, and called for a price increase.[15]

Uranium mining[edit]
In 2005 there were 17 deposits on the state balance account.[16] Three of them Vatutine, Central, and Michurinske were being developed, while an ore enrichment factory was being built at Novokostiantyniv.[16] Number of deposits are exhausted (i.e. Devladove, Zhovtorichenske, Pershotravneve, Bratske).[17][16]

List of reactors[edit]
Main article: List of nuclear reactors Ukraine
See also: List of power stations in Ukraine
All of Ukraine's RBMK reactors (the type involved in the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster) were located at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. All of the reactors there have been shut down, leaving only the much safer VVER reactors operating in the country.[1] Three of the reactors listed were built in post-independence Ukraine, with the first one of these being constructed in 1995; the other sixteen reactors the country inherited from the Soviet Union.
