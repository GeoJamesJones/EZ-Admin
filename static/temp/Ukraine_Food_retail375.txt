TRENDS
Ukrainian consumers spending power continued to decrease in 2016 following the devaluation of the local hryvnia currency in 2015. Whilst salaries were not noted for any growth significance, prices of fast moving consumer goods were tied to foreign currencies value as well as higher transportation costs. As a result, Ukrainian consumers continued to favour domestic products and switch from premium to economy and standard offers, preferring the most essential products whilst reducing their expenditure on perceived treats such as chocolate confectionery, and favouring retailers that offered the best promotions.
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
In 2016, chained operators contributed the most to value sales of grocery retailers due to the successful location of such outlets, and their varied assortments of high-quality products and flexible pricing policies and promotions. Fozzy Group and ATB-Market TOV were the biggest players, respectively accounting for value shares of 13% and 12%. ATB-Market impressed with 786 outlets and Fozzy operated 520 outlets in 2016.
PROSPECTS
The performance of grocery retailers will continue to be closely linked with the force of economic and political developments in the country. In the short term, the military conflict in eastern Ukraine will continue making it more complex for the domestic economy to recover at a rapid pace and consumers spending power will remain low. As a result, Ukrainians will continue to prioritise essential products such as groceries. In the medium term, under an optimistic economic growth scenario, consumer confidence will increase in tandem with growing income levels and spending on products, including groceries, should therefore rise more dynamically. Such an upsurge will result in grocery retailers recording a 1% value CAGR at constant 2016 prices, reaching UAH381.5 billion in 2021.
