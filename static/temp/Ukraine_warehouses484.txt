Large-scale fire in Kyiv warehouses extinguished
No casualties reported 
17:19, 3 February 2019













112 Agency


Firefighters eliminated a large-scale fire in a warehouse building in Desnyansky district of Kyiv. This is reportedby the press office of the State Emergency Service. The fire was extinguished as of 14:30 on Sunday. The cause of the fire is being established. No casualties are reported. 137 personnel and 35 units of equipment were involved in extinguishing the fire. We recall that on February 2 at 11:52, a fire broke out in a warehouse building (storage of power tools, plastic, and cardboard) in Ukraine's capital. As of 14:30, the fire area was 7,000 square meters. There was a threat of fire spreading on the adjacent building.
Related:  Medicines and nutritional supplements: U.S. to send humanitarian aid to Venezuela Due to the presence of combustible materials in the warehouses and the absence of firebreaks, the fire spread quickly. In addition, there was no external fire water supply on the territory of the warehouses. To provide fire tankers with water, rescuers had to lay long-haul trunk lines. However, the water pressure in fire hydrantswas not sufficient to effectively eliminate the fire, so it was necessary to additionally bring water to the site of the fire. In the evening of the same day, the fire was localized.
