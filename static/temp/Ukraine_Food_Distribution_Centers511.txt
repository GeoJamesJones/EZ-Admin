Ukraine, Malta interested in creation of distribution center for food




        1 min read
      






Ukraine and Malta are interested in implementation of joint projects in the agricultural sector, especially in logistics, Deputy Agricultural Policy and Food Minister Olha Trofimtseva has said.
Despite the fact that bilateral trade in agriculture between our countries is small, we see a potential in cooperation in the investment area, the press service of the ministry said, citing Trofimtseva.
She said that the creation of the distribution center could be interesting for some types of agricultural products and food, including processed products exported to African countries.
It is important for us to approve the concrete business model for operation of this distribution center for Ukrainian food in Malta, taking into account all the economic factors, she said.
The sides decided to form a technical group to draw up a business model concept for the distribution center, which will be presented in the near term.
