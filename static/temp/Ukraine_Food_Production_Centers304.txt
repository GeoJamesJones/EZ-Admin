 Popular Ukrainian dishes
Ukrainian cuisine is the collection of the various cooking traditions of the Ukrainian people accumulated over many years. The cuisine is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil (chornozem) from which its ingredients come and often involves many components.[1]
The national dish of Ukraine that undeniably originates from the country is borsch. However varenyky and holubtsi are also considered national favourites of the Ukrainian people and are common meal in traditional Ukrainian restaurants.[2]
Often referred to as the breadbasket of Europe[3] the Ukrainian cuisine emphasises the importance of wheat and grain to the Ukrainian people and its often tumultuous history with it. The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye as well as staple vegetables such as potato, cabbages, mushrooms and beetroots. Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic techniques as well as other European techniques, a by product of years of foreign jurisdiction and influence.
The Ukrainian cuisine incorporates a variety of different food branches (carbohydrates, fats, protein, fruits and vegetables) due to the large size of the country and the plentiful edible resources. Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process - at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed or baked. This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian cuisine.[4]
