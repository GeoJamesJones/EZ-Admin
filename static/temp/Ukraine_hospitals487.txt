Please note: The Department of State assumes no responsibility or liability for the professional ability or reputation of, or the quality of services provided by, the entities or individuals whose names appear on the following lists. Inclusion on this list is in no way an endorsement by the Department or the U.S. government. Names are listed alphabetically, and the order in which they appear has no other significance. The information on the list is provided directly by the local service providers; the Department is not in a position to vouch for such information.
Medical facilities in Ukraine do not meet Western standards. Travelers with pre-existing conditions should carefully consider whether adequate care would be available during a trip to Ukraine. We encourage U.S. citizens planning a trip to Ukraine to purchase travelers insurance before departing and to familiarize themselves with the conditions of their existing medical coverage and medical resources in Ukraine. Nomedical facilitiesin Ukraine accept U.S. health insurance plans for direct payment.Private clinicscan be as expensive as similar clinics in the United States and may require payment in advance. If you wish to purchase health insurance while in Ukraine, please contact any insurance company you trust. Major insurance companies offer health insurance plans for foreigners.
In case of a medical emergency, please contact the U.S. Embassy Consular Section at your earliest convenience.

Routine Medical Problems
When confronted by a medical problem, the first step is to determine the seriousness and to decide whether the patient is better off staying home, in a hotel, with a friend or family member and using available medicine or whether the patient should seek additional assistance at a healthcare facility. Conditions such as mild gastrointestinal distress, respiratory illness, painless skin irritation, colds, and other common problems often resolve themselves without professional medical attention.
The Embassy maintains a list of local medical facilities, some with English-speaking staff, where help can be found if the situation warrants professional care.
Many cases warranting care abroad are handled as routine departures on commercial flights. In these cases, consular section staff may be able to facilitate boarding on the next available flight, arrange ambulance transport to the aircraft, and request medical personnel meet the aircraft at the destination airport. The patient must be well enough to fly on a regularly scheduled flight to a city in Western Europe or the United States. Sometimes the patient may need to be accompanied by a family member, friend, or qualified medical personnel. If needed, the consular section can request boarding for both the ill U.S. citizen and the accompanying passenger. Airlines sometimes require a written release from the passenger or his or her doctor to transport someone who is ill. Please consult with the airline for any specific requirements. Please note, the ill U.S. citizens or his or her family is responsible for all costs related to medical care and/or medical evacuation.
Problems Requiring Care at a Western Facility
In most cases, U.S. diplomats and military personnel travel to Western Europe for medical care. Private U.S. citizens may seek medical care in Germany or any Western European country with the understanding that pre-payment in the national currency is often necessary and a local physician must authorize a hospital admission. The US Consulate General in Frankfurt (49) 69 7535-0, 7532-3700 (after hours), fax: 748-938 can provide information on German medical facilities. The ability of the Consulate to intervene on behalf of U.S. citizens especially transiting passengers wishing hospitalization in Germany is limited.
