1.    Introduction

1.1.  Executive Summary


      Objectives


        The three objectives of this report are to describe the current situation in the Ukrainian food retailing market1

        for potential investors, provide an overview of the main administrative and regulatory barriers to entry, as

        well as present short descriptions of the top 25 Ukrainian food retailers in 2002. The sections of this report                   Deleted:profiles

      address each of these objectives respectively.


      This report was prepared for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), member of the World Bank Group,

      by Tebodin Ukraine with funding from the Government of Norway. Most of the information was obtained

      through face-to-face interviews with key Ukrainian retailers, as well as with local experts such as trade

      authorities, merchandise and equipment suppliers, retail promoters, financial organizations, and
      consumers2. Detailed data on administrative barriers was provided by the Ukrainian Marketing Group (UMG)

        through a quantitative survey of 77 supermarkets and hypermarkets throughout Ukraine.


        This report does not represent the opinions of IFC, nor of the Government of Norway.


        Main Findings


                  In 2002, according to reports of the State Statistics Committee, Ukrainian retail trade turnover

                  exceeded US$ 12 BN, or US$ 250 per capita, with an annual growth rate of 15% in real terms.

                  Food retailing comprised approximately 50% of the market.


                  The Ukrainian retail market is in an early stage of development. There are only about 2 retail outlets

                  (both food and non-food) per 1000 inhabitants, and the corresponding retail sales area is only

                  135 square meters per 1,000 inhabitants. This can be compared to 10 outlets per 1,000 inhabitants

                  in Poland and 16 in Hungary.


                  The market is highly fragmented. There were only approximately 750 modern format stores
                  (supermarkets and hypermarkets)3 in Ukraine in 2002. The share of retail trade going through these

                  outlets is estimated at less than 10% overall, and at about 19% in Kyiv.


                  Today there are approximately 20 food retail chains operating in Ukraine, but only three can be

                  called national players with stores in more than 3 regions in addition to Kyiv. Of these, only one 

                  Billa - is a foreign investment. Another foreign investor, Metro, is in the process of entering the

                  market.


                  Over the next 5 years local players will be expanding quickly and foreign players are expected to

                  enter the market. Key cities  Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia will offer the bulk of

       respectively.4


       Ukrainian authorities have declared support to foreign retailers interested in entering the country.

       As stated in the Instruction of the President of Ukraine dated 28 December 2002 No. 1-1/1658 to

       local authorities, they should consider proposals for construction of modern shopping centers and

       provide relevant support, facilitate the process of land allotment, and make provisions for land plots

       with the required infrastructure for future retail outlets in the regional development plans.

       Experience of current retailers clearly shows that good relations with local authorities are a key

       success factor in overcoming the administrative barriers to market entry.


       The main administrative barriers to retail in Ukraine center on selection of appropriate retail space,

       the high cost of land, and the bureaucracy involved in dealing with state officials. The extent of such

       barriers varies significantly, however, depending on whether a company buys, rents, or builds

       premises.


                        Green-field construction: For retailers who opted for green-field site construction,

                        obtaining land possession rights was the most significant administrative barrier: three-

                        quarters cited bureaucratic procedures involved in obtaining permits for land

                        possession rights as a barrier to doing business. Another 76% of these retailers cited

                        high prices on land plots as an administrative barrier, while just over half had

                        difficulties finding suitable land plots.


                        Purchasing space: For retailers having purchased retail space, the cost of premises

                        was cited as the main barrier by just under half of respondents. While bureaucracy

                        related to obtaining permits from state officials remained a difficulty for these retailers,

                        it was cited just over one-third of respondents.


                        Renting space: The main difficulties for retailers who rent their premises centered on

                        high rental rates and difficulties in finding appropriate space for their outlets, cited by

                        just under half of retailers. Various administrative difficulties related to official

                        bureaucracy are significantly mitigated, and cited by under 20% of respondents.



       As more than 90% of all food items sold in Ukraine are of local origin, the key difficulties

       experienced in ongoing operations by current retailers include the disruption of deliveries,

       fluctuating prices and unstable quality of product.


       Personnel issues and finding qualified staff also cause operational concerns: half of retailers cited

       the level of staff qualifications as a key barrier, while one-fifth claimed that the low level of staff

       culture was a major barrier to their operations.

1.2. Definitions of retail formats


When speaking about the retail sector, experts sometimes use different languages by giving the same

things various names. For example, some say `chain' retail, while others call it `large' or `modern type', while

all mean `retail chain of stores'.


Definitions of key retail formats currently available in the Ukrainian market are presented below. However, in

practice only some retailers have established stores of a clear format and the major market share still

belongs to mixed retail formats. Therefore, at the moment identification of formats in the Ukrainian retail is

rather conventional.


Hypermarket (no chains currently present in Ukraine, only several stores)
         Sales area  at least 5,000 m2

         Range of products  15,000-30,000 goods (foodstuff share is around 60-70%)

         Target group  owners of shops, restaurants, hotels and other businesses (HoReCa)

         In Ukraine also end consumers with average and below average incomes

         Average purchase  UAH 250-300 (USD 50)

         Inexpensive equipment and plain interior

         Location - outside the city

         In Ukraine  in industrial zones with inconvenient public transport approach

         Parking near entrance


Supermarket (more than 15 chains)
         Sales area  up to 5,000 m2

         Range of products  10,000  12,000 goods (food accounts for about 80%)

         Gross sales margin  25-50% with loyalty / club system

         In Ukraine gross sales margin in supermarkets is lower at the moment  15-20%

         Target group  end consumers with average and above average income

         Average purchase  UAH 50-60 (USD 10)

                                                         7

Discounter (3 chains)
       Sales area  up to 1,000 m2

       Range of products  1,500-3,000 goods (usually only foodstuffs)

       Gross sales margin  10-20%

       Target group  end consumers with average and below average incomes

       Average purchase  UAH 15-20 (USD 3)

       Private labels

2.      Retail Market Overview

2.1. General Description of Ukrainian retail (food and non-food)


Recent retail development is stipulated by the growth of the Ukrainian economy5 that has demonstrated a

positive stable trend since 2000. As shown in Figure 1, in 2000-2001 the retail sector followed the growth of

GDP and industrial production, while in 2002 retail turnover increase outran these two indicators, reaching a

15% rate of growth.

An increase in production volumes by Ukrainian enterprises (especially of foodstuffs and consumer

goods manufacturing) has resulted in retail sales growth and contributed to the promotion of retail.

On the other hand, retail growth has been propelled by an increase in consumer activity based on steady

income growth (more than 20% annual growth rate over 2000-2002). According to official data, average

annual income per household totaled USD 640 in 2002. Taking into account the incompleteness of official

statistics, this amount can be assumed to be much higher (which makes an average annual income per

household about USD 1,200).

According to the forecasting figures of the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance6, household income should rise by
more than 25% in 2003 (forecast by International Center for Policy Studies7 predicts a 14.8% increase). This

forecast is based on the positive financial and economic indicators achieved in Quarter I of 2003. This would

give an additional impetus to retail development, as in Ukraine over 80% of income is spent on the purchase

of goods and services. Similarly, about 60% of household income is spent on food purchases.

It is also remarkable that most foreign direct investment (FDI) was directed into the improvement of

wholesale and retail trade as well as at the food industry. Each of these sectors attracted USD 854 mn, or,

taken together, more than 30% of the total volume of FDI as of 1 January 2003 (data of State Statistics

Committee).

At present the Ukrainian retailing market is characterized by the major trends described below.

      Consolidation of retail business (instead of existing centralization before the 90's) and development of

      large- and small-scale retail chains

      Vertical integration and acquisition of other businesses (mainly agro and food-processing) by retailers.

Vertical integration provides for stable supply and sales. However, in order to guarantee sales growth and

      popularity with consumers, the quality of products manufactured by own enterprises must be very high.

      In the opinion of experts, the share of own brands must not exceed 20% of the product category

      assortment.

      Construction of shopping centers (malls) in large cities

The market for modern sales areas is not saturated, and 4-5-fold growth in the number of shopping centers

      is set to occur within the next 5 years. Shopping centers are developing in large cities where consumers

      are ready to pay for the goods and quality of service that they offer.

      Another recent feature is transformation of street markets into shopping and entertainment centers. This

      provides for smoother adaptation of customers to the new formats.

      Growth of promotional activity of retailers

Such means of promotion as providing materials at the point of sale, producing leaflets, use of consumer

      motivation slogans, support of social and other events are widely employed by retailers.

      Tendency towards merger / association

      The League of Professional Retailers is currently being organized in Ukraine. The goal of this

      association will lie in pursuing the interests of local retailers (both food and non-food). A similar

      industrial union has been active in Russia since 2001: The Association of Retail Trade Companies

      (ACORT).

      Dialogue with local authorities, improving relations between retailers and legislative authorities

      The majority of owners / managers of local rapidly developing retail outlets in all large cities are also

      deputies of the local councils. This provides for smoother resolution of current issues (especially as

      concerns land plot allocation).


2.1.1. Estimated Market Size (food / non-food)


The retail trade industry is one of the key sectors of the Ukrainian economy, and its share of Ukraine's GDP

amounts to about 30% (based on the data of the State Statistics Committee).

Total retail volume declared by all business entities (including physical persons) amounted to UAH 65.6 bn

(or USD 12.3 bn) in 2002 (data of State Statistics Committee). This figure is the most realistic available from

official sources to characterize retail turnover, but it does not allow for making comparisons. That is why
further in this report retail sales of enterprises8 only will be taken into consideration.

The difficulty of performing statistical analysis is one of the key hindrances for making correct estimates of

the actual situation in this sector.



________________________________________________________________________

8 Methodology of State Statistics Committee: retail turnover is determined as the volume of sales of goods to the population

through all operating enterprises (without taking account of their property form) of retail trade network, catering network, as well

as sales by industrial, transport and other non-trading enterprises directly to the population through their pay-offices. Beside this,

retail turnover also includes sales of foodstuffs through the retail network to institutions, organizations and enterprises for

providing meals to their clients (in health centers, kindergartens and schools, hospitals, etc.).




                                                                 10

The data available from State Statistics Committee of Ukraine cannot be considered comprehensive for the

following reasons:

     it is based on official data from companies (data that differs from reality as some enterprises do not
      submit the information in a correct way);

     it does not cover all market players rather only those companies that submit information (local
      regulations do not provide any penalties for non-submission of data to local statistical bodies);

     it is calculated using disputable (non transparent) techniques and methodology;

     it is presented mainly in oblast profile (which makes it extremely difficult to use when analyzing the
      situation in specific cities).

According to reports of the State Statistics Committee, in 2002 the retail sales volumes of Ukrainian

enterprises totaled UAH 39.7 bn, or approximately USD 7.4 bn, 15% higher than in 2001 and almost 40%

higher than 2000. In year-on-year terms, retail volumes have been growing by 14-15% in real terms (in

comparative prices) for two consecutive years, and promise to maintain that growth rate over the coming

years.

The trend in Ukrainian retail trade turnover over the last 6 years is presented in Figure 2. Though retail

turnover in local currency showed stable growth, the situation is different when analyzing the same indicator

in hard currency. The drop of 1998-1999 was the consequence of the Russian financial crisis of August

1998 that had also influenced the Ukrainian economy. The crisis resulted in the sharp devaluation of

Ukrainian currency and a consequent cutback in consumer activity.

The continuos growth in retail turnover volumes started in 2000. As noted above, this trend is related to

overall improvements in the Ukrainian economy, which lead to an increase in consumer activity.

Food sales make up approximately 50% of total retail sales. This indicator is relatively high (for comparison,
in Germany and Poland food sales amount to less than 40% of retail turnover9), as non-food retail is

undergoing a revival after a deep crisis in the mid 90-ies.

Ukrainian goods make more than  of total retail turnover (see Figure 4). At the same time, their share is

much higher in food sales (almost 94%).

   2.1.2. Number of Retail Outlets and Sales Area


   As data on the number of retail outlets differs, information from different sources is presented in this section.

   At the beginning of 2002, Ukrainian retail was characterized by the following indicators:

          Official figures from the State Statistics Committee declare that at the beginning of 2002 there were

          96,393 retail outlets in Ukraine. The total number of outlets had reduced by 37,269, or almost 28%,

          compared to 1995 (see Table 2). Similarly, the number of kiosks remained at the same level, but the

          number of stores (both food and non-food) decreased considerably.

          The reduction in the total number of outlets is connected to a process of consolidation in the retail

          sector and an increase of number of stores of modern format. However, their share in the total
          number of outlets is still less than 1%10.

          Sales per retail outlet amounted to UAH 357,049 (or USD 66,989) as of the end of 2001. This makes

          about a 30% increase over the previous year.

   Retail Density

   The number of retail outlets per 10,000 inhabitants equals 20 (or 2 outlets per 1,000 inhabitants). Available
   sales area (both food and non-food) is currently about 135 m2 per 1,000 inhabitants whereas the norm for
   available sales area that existed in the Soviet Union was 215 m2 per 1,000 inhabitants.

   Total sales area of retail outlets amounted to 6,522,366 m2 as of the end of 2002.

2.2.     Ukrainian Food Retail Sector


2.2.1.   History and trends in food retail


With the breakup of the USSR, one of the world's largest food retail chains disappeared. This centralized

chain had been built up over many years and in the late 80's comprised 800,000 stores across the Soviet

Union, of them more than 116,000 in Ukraine. One-time Prodtorgs and Silpos (food retail regulating

departments in each city district and in the countryside), wholesale food storage, storage for fresh fruit and

vegetables etc. `disappeared' quickly and no substitute has yet come to take their place.


In the former system all shops had their mission: either an ordinary food retail outlet with all main food groups

presented, or a specialized outlet (trade in fresh fruit and vegetables, baby food, food for diabetics, etc.)


Thus, in recent years certain attempts have been made to build up a new distribution and retail system using

both old and new elements.



2.2.2    Comparative analysis across CEE countries


This subchapter presents a comparative analysis of food retail sector developments in the countries of Central

and Eastern Europe (CEE). Data on major trends (by country) are given in Annex 7.


As the Ukrainian retail sector is in the initial stage of its build-up, different development models can be applied.


Based on expert opinion, Ukraine is most likely to follow the Russian model, where local companies dominate

at the moment but foreign retailers gain increasingly more ground. At the same time, the share of modern

formats in Russian retail turnover remains small (about 4-5% in 2002).


On the other hand, experts believe that the Ukrainian authorities are trying to replicate the Polish experience

in their attempt to prevent quick development of retail chains. However, they are attempting to accomplish this

before market saturation, while in Poland it is being initiated afterwards.


  Ukraine: At the end of February 2003 the Council of Entrepreneurs under the Cabinet of Ministers of

  Ukraine announced that it had started working on the draft law `On Retail Chains in Ukraine' together

  with the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. As of April 2003, there is no detailed information on this

  document. However, experts believe that it will be aimed at the protection of local retailers and may

  become another hindrance in the way of foreign investors.


  Poland: In November 2002 the Polish Sejm passed a law on retail trade, designed to defend small

  retailers from encroachment by large chains. The law limits and declares the assortment of goods
  offered by retail chains and sales conditions. Therefore, stores with sales area exceeding 400 m2 are not

  allowed :

  -      to sell goods or services at a price that does not include a markup (exclusion is made only for

         special reasons)

  -      to sell goods for which customers can pay in coupons issued by large chains

  Moreover, there is a special limitation for discount chains: the share of private label products cannot

  exceed 20% of total sales of the chain.


The major differences in retail market development in CEE countries are outlined in Table 4 below.

In the graphs below the main market indicators of the CEE countries are compared.


Basic comparison allows drawing the conclusion that the Ukrainian retail market is far behind similar markets
in other CEE countries.


The amount of foreign direct investment attracted per one Ukrainian is 3.3 times less than per one Russian,
14.3 times less than per one Pole, and 32.6 times less than per one Hungarian (see Figure 5).

Comparison of retail turnover per capita shows that (according to official statistics) an average Ukrainian
spends 4 times less on purchases of food and non-food items than an average citizen of the Baltic States, and
17.5 times less than an average Pole.

Ukrainian retail chain outlets are also less developed than those in other countries (see Figure 7). For

example, in Poland there are 98 outlets per 10,000 inhabitants while in Ukraine there are only 20.

As shown in Figure 8, modern formats have a relatively low share of retail turnover in Ukraine and Russia -

about 10%, vs. 50-70% in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.


At the same time, the share of street markets in Ukraine and Russia is high (30-50%) compared to 10% in

Poland and 1% in the Czech Republic and Hungary.

2.2.3.  Trends in Ukrainian food retail


The following trends accompany Ukrainian food retail development:


      Development of large-scale formats and transition to self-service technology. Establishment of new

      retail formats on the basis of the old food stores / loss of specialization of the old outlets

      Such retail formats as hypermarkets and supermarkets have quickly gained popularity as a substitute

      for old-format stores. This has led to the purchase of almost all former univermags, universams and

      gastronoms and the set-up of new retail outlets instead. Thus, the majority of stores became multi-

      profile, trading both in food and non-food, and stores with a narrow-specialization have almost

      disappeared.


      Use of modern retail technologies including equipment of retail outlets and IT solutions for chain stores


      Establishment of distribution centers by the largest retail chains

      Following worldwide practice, further development of distribution centers will continue with the growth of

      retail chains.


      Appearance of private labels

      Though there are only a few examples of private labeling in Ukrainian retail, this segment is expected to

      grow soon. Private labels have already appeared at Furshet (Furshet brand for canned vegetables and

      ravioli), Silpo (Baba Galia for flour), Euromart (Euromart brand for disposable tableware and ravioli) and

      ATB (ATB brand for cereals, napkins); all of these products are manufactured locally. Spar has also

      placed private labels on the shelves of its stores, but all 150 items are imported.


      On-line stores and delivery services development

      Some chains (like Furshet, Megamarket, Tavriya-V) have developed their Internet sites with

      incorporated on-line stores where consumers can buy products without leaving their homes. Home and

      office delivery services have recently become an additional means of increasing consumer loyalty.


      Development of franchising retail

      Retail on franchising terms is currently represented by Spar. This growing chain is owned by a

      Ukrainian company that bought a franchise from Spar International.


      Low level of foreign investments in Ukrainian food retail




                                                        17

Forecast for Ukrainian retail market development


The current period in the development of the Ukrainian retail market is characterized by dynamic changes.
Supermarkets12 are mushrooming and the fight for consumers is ahead.


As international experience shows, tough competition between the chains starts when the share of

supermarkets in a city's retail turnover comes close to 30%. Therefore, severe competition is expected to

break out within the next 2-3 years.


Local experts think that in two or three years the leaders among large retail chains will be finally shaped in

Ukraine. These retailers will differ only in some aspects, including the presence of private labels on the

shelves of supermarkets and offers of additional advantages to consumers.


In the opinion of retailers and producers, the share of supermarkets in retail turnover within the next 5 years

can reach 20-40%, depending on the region. The largest share is to be gained in Kyiv and such cities as

Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Lviv, where the level of consumption is relatively high. In other regions,

supermarkets have decent opportunities to enlarge their share, and these will definitely grow from the current

level of under 10%.


New entrants and their plans

Over the next 5 years both international and new local players are expected to appear in the Ukrainian retail

market. It is expected that they will toughen the competition and contribute to the development of the retail

sector.



      Metro AG is entering the Ukrainian market with its wholesale subdivision  Metro Cash & Carry. It has

      already set up a local branch  Metro Cash & Carry Ukraine, and the opening of its first outlet has been

      scheduled for 24 August 2003 (see chapter 5 for details).

      Having gained positive experience in Russia, such companies as French Auchan and Turkish Migros

      (which operates in Russia as Ramstore) are considering a south-west move to Ukraine.

      Europe's largest retailer Carrefour (France) has already announced its development plans in Russia

      and is expected to enter the Ukrainian market.

      Leading British retailer Tesco is also carefully observing the situation in the Ukrainian market.



Perspective retail formats:

In the opinion of retailers, the most convenient and, therefore, prospective formats of food retail are:


       supermarkets of 1,000  2,000 m2 sales area located in the residential districts (neighborhood

       supermarkets);
       wholesales and retail stores (cash & carry) with more than 5,000 m2 sales area;
       hypermarkets of at least 8,000  10,000 m2 sales area;
       mega shopping centers (more than 20,000 m2 sales area).


________________________________________________________________________

12Hereafter, all modern retail formats are meant, if not specified




                                                                  18

2.2.4 Investments in the sector


Major foreign investments in Ukraine's food retail market include:


        Western NIS Enterprise Fund (USG Investment Fund) was the first major foreign investor in the

        development of retail and wholesale in Ukraine. In 1999, this USG funded institution invested

        USD 2.4 mn into development of the first cash-and-carry chain in Ukraine (Euromart). In 2000, another

        equity fund  Commercial Capital  provided for the second investment inflow in the amount of

        USD 4.5 mn. Though great expansion plans have been declared, the Euromart chain still consists of

        5 outlets: 2 in Kyiv and 1 each in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia.


        Austrian Euro-BILLA has invested more than USD 20 mn in the development of a western type

        supermarket chain in Ukraine. When starting its activity, BILLA announced plans to open 5-7

        supermarkets under the BILLA brand every year in Ukraine for the next five years. However, as of

        January 2003, there were only 8 supermarkets operating in the BILLA chain (3 in Kyiv, 2 in

        Dnipropetrovsk, 2 in Kharkiv and 1 in Zaporizhia). Worth mentioning is that at present BILLA is the only

        western managed retail chain in Ukraine (until Metro's start up).


        German Metro AG is entering the Ukrainian market with its wholesale subdivision  Metro Cash &

        Carry. It has already set up a local branch  Metro Cash & Carry Ukraine, and the opening of its first

        outlet has been scheduled for 24 August 2003 (construction started on 11 February 2003). Metro plans

        the development of cash & carry chain in Ukraine through establishment of outlets in the largest cities:

        first, in Kyiv, and later in Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Donetsk, Kharkov, Zaporizhia.



2.2.5      Customers


It is the opinion of experts that official statistics present the typical end consumer in Ukraine as poorer than he

really is. In this section only actual data reflecting real consumer abilities and preferences are provided.


Portrait of average customer of supermarkets:

Age: 22-60
Monthly income:  USD 100 (per family member)
Frequency of visiting supermarkets: 12 times a month, or approximately 2-3 visits a week

Transport: 45.6% - on foot, 29.4% - by own car, 23.5% - by public transport

Loyalty to the selected store: most customers tend to go to supermarkets of other chains as well.


Average bill in supermarkets

Average regular purchase: UAH 30-100 (depending on city)

Average holiday purchase: UAH 50-200 (depending on city)

Product categories bought: 80-90% - food

Average consumer buys 100-120 items during a month

Source: UMG survey, data from retailers


Visits to supermarkets are becoming an alternative for family entertainment. Shopping enjoys wide popularity

both with adults and with kids who like to drive in carts and grab sweets and toys. Worth mentioning is that

unplanned purchases make up to 70% of purchases, therefore the total amount of the bill can often surprise

the consumer at the check-out terminal.


Western consumers have higher brand awareness than their Ukrainian counterparts. Lack of brand loyalty is

considered to be one of the reasons why Western retailers are slow to enter Ukrainian market.



                                                           19

However, the brand thinking of local customers is being developed. Most visitors to supermarkets are not very

eager to buy products from unknown manufacturers and prefer products of well-known brands (especially

local). However, for some people price is still a key issue and unbranded products are purchased mainly

because of the opportunity to save money.


  Fruit and vegetable juices manufactured by Odesa Baby Food Cannery represent one of the first good

  examples of unbranded products. This juice series has been highly rated by customers as all juices are

  made from fresh fruit. Another comment: these juices appeared in Tetra Pak cardboard packaging of white

  color with no pictures and only the name of the juice on it, at first surprising consumers by its plain design.


2.2.6 Estimated Market Size (food retail)


Food sales make up approximately 50% of total retail sales. According to official information from the State

Statistics Committee, food retail turnover reached nearly USD 4 bn in 2002. However, estimated food retail

turnover currently exceeds USD 13 bn for Ukraine, when estimates are based on current figures for

consumer spending from the State Statistics Comittee, and the share that food purchases claim of this total

expenditure amount.


The comparative increase in both food and total retail turnover is presented in Figure 9 below. Similar to the

decrease in total retail turnover, the drop in food retail turnover in 1998-1999 was a consequence of the

financial crisis of August 1998, which resulted in a sharp drop in the Ukrainian currency's purchasing power,

and a consequent cutback in consumer activity. In addition to this, the Ukrainian population has shown a

negative trend since 1994.

________________________________________________________________________

13These figures are taken from official data on retail / food retail turnover from the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine. As noted
in the text, if official figures are assessed in a bottom-up approach (ie figures for consumer spending are used as a basis to
calculate turnover) retail turnover exceeded USD 13 billion in 2002 (*). Such obvious discrepancies in official data are ignored by
the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine at present.




                                                                   20

Estimated annual food retail turnover per capita is USD 274, or UAH 1,460, if figures for consumer spending

are used to calculate this total. At the same time, using official data on food retail turnover gives a value of

around USD 75, or UAH 400.

2.2.7     Number of Retail Outlets


Major marketing agencies (such as ACNielsen, Ukrainian Marketing Group, Gfk, Pulse) conduct retail
censuses on a regular basis.


According to ACNielsen data, at the end of 2002 there were about 300 hypermarkets, supermarkets and cash
& carries in Ukraine (or more than 500 modern-format stores if mini-markets are included), which combined

                      Results of a retail census carried out by MEMRB and Ukrainian Marketing Group in 2002 show that the

                      total number of retail outlets (including open markets) amounts to 113,486. Similarly, the number of

                      supermarkets (both food and non-food) is 459 outlets, or only 0.4% of all retail outlets (1.3% of total

                      number of retail outlets excluding open markets). Detailed data are presented below:

In our opinion, the number of Ukrainian food supermarkets (including hyper-, mini-markets, as well as cash &

carries) almost doubled in 2002, and in the beginning of 2003 it can be estimated at the level of 700-750

outlets (more than 200 of them located in the 7 largest population centers of Ukraine).


2.2.8                   Main food retail formats


It is extremely difficult to squeeze the Ukrainian retail into a common framework. As described in Chapter
1.1.2. even experts often call same formats by different names. `Chain' retail, `large' retail, `modern type'  all
these names mean the same generally accepted retail formats worldwide.

16Univermag is a large city mall or a department store selling non-food items (sales area is 3,500-22,000 m2).




                                                                                     22

However, in practice only some retailers have established stores of a clear format (supermarkets like Billa and
Spar, hypermarkets like Maxi, Aeroportovsky) and the major market share still belongs to mixed retail formats
(a mixture between cash & carry, hypermarket and supermarket such as Furshet and Megamarket).
Therefore, at the moment identification of formats in Ukrainian retail is rather conventional.


Retailers mention the psychological factor  change from street markets to supermarkets is a gradual process
 as one of the main reasons for diversity and mixture of formats. Therefore, retailers prefer not to shock
consumers, but to please them and develop their preferences in favor of modern shopping instead of street
markets.


Lack of investments can be also mentioned in this respect, as considerable amounts are required in order to
adjust a former production facility or a warehouse to a supermarket or a hypermarket format.


In some experts' opinion, mixed formats are one of the key survival factors in a transitional phase.


Thus, at present modern formats adjoin traditional ones in Ukrainian retail. Major existing formats of retail
outlets are listed below.


    Traditional retail outlets:
                    gastronom / grocery
                    universam
                    kiosk
                    pavilion
                    street or open market


    New formats:
                    hypermarket
                    cash & carry
                    supermarket
                    discounter


In terms of retail turnover distribution the situation is as follows (see Figure 13): share of street markets and
groceries is high  about 50 and 40% correspondingly. The remaining 10% is shared between modern
formats.


Figure 13. Ukrainian retail turnover distribution between retail formats in 2002 (estimate)



                       Supermarkets  Discounters
                                                                                  Groceries
       Hypermarkets          6%           3%
                                                                                     40%
             1%




        Street markets
              50%




Source: experts' estimate



Open markets are still one of the most popular forms of retail, though chain companies are working hard trying

to displace them. For example, in Kyiv (according to the information from city trade department) the share of

open markets in the city's retail turnover reaches 30-35% in food sales (in meat sales  90-95%) and 20-25%

in consumer goods.

2.2.9     Key Players in Ukrainian food retail


2.2.9.1 Key food retailers on the Ukrainian market


All companies active in the Ukrainian food retail can be classified by different criteria such as store format,

number of outlets, retail turnover volume and regional spread.


As there are practically no `clear' formats in the Ukrainian market, all classifications are rather conventional. It

is evident that the majority of retailers operate in the supermarket format, while discounters do not enjoy such

popularity.

     Store format                 Sales area, m2                                       Brands

                                                                             Market, Megamarket, Tavriya-V

Though one can judge about the importance of a retailer based on the number of set up outlets, the real status

of companies can be evaluated on the basis of a retail turnover. However, these figures are usually not

disclosed by companies. Data on number of outlets and sales area are presented in Table 7.

The following conventional classification by regional spread can be suggested in order to determine the

impact of retailers on the Ukrainian retail market:

         national retailers (see Table 8 for detailed profile)

In Ukraine there are only a few chains that can be called `national retailers', in the true sense of the word. The

key players on a country-wide scale (ie those that have set up stores in more than 3 oblasts) are Fozzy,

Rainford and Furshet. Billa and Euromart, having outlets in Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhia,

follow the leaders. Recently Spar joined this group by announcing expansion to the Cherkasy and Luhansk

markets.

         regional retailers (see Table 9 for detailed profile)

Companies highly influencing the retail industry of more than 1 oblast can be called regional. Their activities

are usually concentrated in neighboring territories/oblasts and they are not of national importance. This group

unites such companies as ATB-Market (Eastern Ukraine) and Intermarket (Western Ukraine).

         local retailers (see Table 10 for detailed profile)

Members of this group have concentrated their outlets in the area of one city or oblast. For example, Kit

covers the market of Zaporizhia, Obzhora dominates in Donetsk, Tavriya-V and Rorus play a key role in the

Odesa market. Kyiv hosts many local retailers such as Velyka Kyshenia, Tiko Market, Begemot, West Line,

Megamarket and others.

Regional food retail coverage is illustrated in Figure 14.

According to experts' estimates, supermarkets' share in total retail turnover can reach 15-20% in 2003.


Although the supermarket sector is highly fragmented, national-level retailers dominate this segment. Regional
and local retail chains share the rest equally. A tentative breakdown of supermarkets turnover is presented in
Figure 15 below.

2.2.9.2 Factors that influenced the decision to start retail business


Among the factors that determined companies' development in retail, the following issues were mentioned as

key by retailers:
         attractive market sector,

         existing niche in the local market,

         growing demand by end consumers for high-quality retail services,

         positive experience in the wholesale trade and developed infrastructure for retail start up,

         high profitability of retail business,

         convincing results of conducted market research,

         cooperation with leading international retailers.


                                                              28

A few retailers also mentioned that the Ukrainian legal framework of the early 90's considerably contributed to
the emerging of many new trading businesses: legislation pushed companies towards trading activity, as it
was quite difficult to start up production.


Some companies started their retail business with a single outlet (which could have been small and even non-
food oriented) without having a retail chain in mind. However, having gained good experience with one shop,
those companies developed large successful chains.


The trading company Intermarket started its activities in 1992 trading with clothes and foot-wear, having only
7 employees in a shop with a total area of 110 2 in Halytska St., Lviv. Market analysis and understanding of

consumer needs in the mid-90's became the key factors for a profile change to trade in food and

accompanying goods. In 1996 the new name `Intermarket' was introduced; since that time the company has

been opening new shops each year. And now it works in three formats  cash & carry, supermarket,

discounter  and has 13 outlets and comprehensive development plans.

2.2.9.3 Background of retailers


The majority of retailers started their activities with the wholesale trade and / or import of foodstuffs in the
beginning of the 90's. Having gained a certain amount of experience with the development of their own
distribution network, many companies faced the necessity of opening their own retail outlet (as some traders
admit, `just to see'). Since this niche was open, the retail business brought about a positive experience which
further lead to a company's reorientation.


Some companies selected a diversification strategy and after development of retail chains they made the
decision to acquire other businesses. Therefore, many companies in Ukraine involved in retail have a
diversified business portfolio and retail is only one part of their activities.


The scheme below describes the development of most trading companies:


Wholesale         Distributors          Opening       Gaining positive         Retail        Acquisition   Sales of

company           network               1st retail    experience in            network       of other      their

                                                                                                           own

                                                                                                           network


As access to sufficient financial resources was not simple, companies had to raise their own capital for

development in the retail industry. So, some companies presently active in the retail market earned their

starting capital in other economic sectors (like oil and gas).


Business concentration brought into existence diversified trading and industrial groups that have their own

distribution and retail networks, as well as their own production facilities.


Food brands belonging to the leading trading and industrial groups are:

     -    Fozzy Group: Miagkov and 220V (vodka and low alcohol), Odessa (champagne), Izmail (wine),

          Nizhyn (canned vegetables), Olivier (mayonnaise);

     -    Rainford Group: Rainford (chocolate), Bon Boisson (mineral water and soft drinks), Karat (vodka),

          Miasnaya Gildiya (meat), Bravo and Schodnia (dairy), Vivat (bread)

2.3.     Local practices


2.3.1    Discount / loyalty systems


Ukrainian retailers use such major types of discounts as:

a.  Special offers (special price for some goods for a few days)

b.  Price reduction during certain hours or days (usually 9-11 AM or 9-11 PM, and during weekends or on

    Sundays)

c.  Special prices to discount or client card holders (as part of a loyalty system)


    a.   Special offers allow promoting a certain product or brand (sometimes, completely new or with a new

         design) making it more accessible for customers and forming a consumption habit. In some shops

         special offers cover one product from each group, which draws poorer customers into becoming loyal

         visitors.

    b.   Announcement of discounts for the entire product range during certain time periods helps to spread

         customer flow more equally. Such a need arises when a store is well-located (and long check-out

         lines occur) or when a store wants to draw additional customer groups (in some cash & carry outlets

         wholesale prices are effective on Sundays).

    c.   The way of getting a discount card differs by retail chain: you can either make a single purchase for a

         certain amount or just buy a card (price varies from UAH 15 to 100). Some chains provide city

         authorities with discount cards. Most retailers provide special discounts to their personnel, which

         allows double benefits: sales increase and motivation of personnel rises.


The discount rates granted to cardholders range from 1 to 7% depending on the chain and special conditions

(amount accumulated on the card account, cost of last month's purchases, etc.).


Recently, joint programs with commercial banks have become very popular. For example, you can get a

discount in a certain supermarkets or become a discount cardholder, if you have a card issued by a certain

bank (if you have a plastic card from Pravex Bank you automatically get 1% discount card at Velyka Kyshenia

chain).


Discount or client cards can be ordered in Ukraine (they are produced by specialized local companies). The

average period for the production of plastic cards is 10-12 working days.




2.3.2.   Seasonality / changes of sales


The seasonality of sales is expressed through fluctuations in the number of purchases and average check

amounts during certain time periods (on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis).


Retail customer flow (at a neighborhood supermarket) during the day is divided as follows:

    -    housewives and pensioners are usual morning visitors;

    -    those who are employed are evening (after 6 PM) visitors.


The highest number of visitors occurs on Friday nights and Saturdays, while during working days and

Sundays the number is level.




                                                       30

Monthly peaks are related to the salary pay days (in some companies the whole salary is paid at the beginning

of the month, while in others it is paid in two parts  advance in the middle of the month and the rest of salary

at the beginning of the month).


Wholesalers' flow to the stores that provide services for professional customers - HoReCa and small retail

outlets - is high during working hours (10 AM to 5PM) of working week days (Monday through Friday). The

wholesalers' flow is usually evenly distributed throughout the month.


Almost all retailers marked annual peaks of sales around the following traditional and religious holidays:

                           -  New Year (and orthodox Christmas  7 January)

                           -  Women's Day (8 March)

                           -  Easter (usually falls in March or April)

                           -  May Holidays (1-2 and 9 May)

                           -  Independence Day (especially for the stores located in the city centers  people are outside and

                              spend more on food and drinks)

                           -  Valentine's Day (14 February)  this holiday had recently gained popularity


The New Year period (mid December  1 January) is marked by an increase of up to 60-70% in average

sales. Other holidays provide for a 15-20% increase over normal work periods.


Special days for each region include City Day, professional holidays affecting many people in a particular

industrial region (like Miner's Day in Donetsk, Metallurgist Day in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia) and public

events (such as soccer games, concerts, etc.). It is mainly outlets located in the city center, a pedestrian zone

or next to the area where an event takes place that experience sales increases on these days.


The majority of retailers experience a sales decrease in summer (about 10-15%), although some of them deny

this fact.


The tentative annual sales distribution (based on retailers' estimate) is presented in Figure 16 below.

2.3.3.     Distribution system17


The Ukrainian distribution system is based on the application of two main schemes:


        I.     Direct supply




      Producer                                                                    Retailer




This scheme is one of the most commonly used in Russia, and presently it is gaining increasingly more

influence in the Ukrainian market.

The direct supply scheme is used mainly only by the largest producers due to its high costs (own logistics /

transportation units) and risks. Producers usually apply such a system through their regional branches or by

means of direct deliveries.

The direct scheme allows the producer to receive an additional profit and to facilitate the production planning

process due to close contacts with retailers (which allow for receipt of the latest information and a quick

response to consumers' needs and competitors' actions). This scheme also contributes to increasing a retail

chain's influence on the market as a whole.

In the largest Ukrainian cities, which account for the lion's share of sales, the majority of producers practice a

`mixed' scheme: a producer works directly only with VIP-clients (large retail chains), and small-scale retail is

left to distributors.

Many large juice, beverage, dairy and meat manufacturers use the direct scheme. With dairy and meat

products it works especially well due to the short shelf life of products.


        II.    Supply through intermediate agents


a) Supply through distribution company




      Producer                                  Distributor                       Retailer




In contrast to the American and European practice, where retail chains fulfill distributors' functions through

their own distribution centers, in Ukraine the distributor's task within this scheme is to supply goods directly to

retail outlets. Operational control is carried out by trade representatives who supervise merchandise lay-out,

inventory stocks and plan the delivery schedule.

This scheme is used mainly by small-scale producers or firms just entering the market. They work through

distribution companies which give them favorable conditions. After gaining some experience, transition to the

direct scheme is possible.

One of the modifications of this scheme is an exclusive distributor model. In this case, a distribution company

can receive rights for product distribution in a specific region(s) or the whole country. However, such a

distributor should have a good track record and a large regional network in order to gain producers'

confidence and receive considerable discounts.

                                                               32

b) supply through distribution company and wholesaler




      Producer                    Distributor               Wholesaler                 Retailer




The scheme with the participation of a wholesale company came into existence mainly due to producer's low

amount of control over the distribution process. However, the recent trend is to eliminate wholesalers from the

distribution chain. This is a major reason why recently many of them have either gone out of business due to

bankruptcy or changed their profile (some of them began distribution or production activities).


The main trends observed in the Ukrainian distribution system are as follows:

       Distribution channels have been minimized, while the usage of the direct supply scheme has intensified

       over the last years. At the same time, it is almost impossible to estimate the share of different supply

       channels as their usage varies by market sector.

       For example, in the opinion of juice market operators, in this market segment sales through distributors

       account for less than 10% of total sales volume in the large cities and 30-50% in the regions. The

       remainder is left to direct distribution.

       Distribution companies have been forced to narrow their product portfolio, as promotion of specific

       trademarks (not competing with each other) has become the main task of a distributor.

       The number of distributors linked to one particular producer has reduced (in large cities  usually to 2-

       4). This is connected to territorial division between the distribution companies.

       With market development, the distributors' margin has decreased to 10-15% in 2002-2003 from more

       than 20% in 1999 (in most competitive markets this profit margin is only 2-3%).

       Local distribution companies have begun diversifying their business activities, as there is a fear that

       retail chain development (and setting up of retail chains' own distribution centers) will lead to a crisis

       situation for distributers in 2-3 years.

       Joint mutually beneficial businesses have been established by producers and distributors. In this case,

       producers receive additional guarantees of successful merchandise promotion and distributors gain

       additional resources for their activities and provisions for long-term cooperation.

3.        Administrative Procedures



When opening a retail outlet in Ukraine, a potential investor should be ready to face certain difficulties. Mainly

these are caused by the need for extensive cooperation with state authorities, but in addition to this, the

process of retail trade itself is not inherently simple. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the main

difficulties which a business-owner has to overcome in order to open and to run a successful retail business in

Ukraine.


In order to produce this chapter, research was conducted with the owners and managers of 77 hyper and

supermarket retailers from different cities of Ukraine in early 2003.                 18  The major administrative barrier

facing retailers was found to be the selection of an appropriate land plot and obtaining plot possession rights:

52% of survey respondents faced significant problems while selecting an appropriate land plot. Similarly for

76% of those surveyed, high prices of land plots were cited as a serious barrier. Intricate bureaucratic

procedures of obtaining land possession rights caused difficulties for 76% of retailers.


It should be noted that approximately half (51 %) of the questioned companies started their business in 2000-

2002.


Key operational barriers in Ukraine are questions dealing with personnel hiring and the process of arranging

regular supplies. Due to the lack of qualified and skilled employees, most owners of retail business often need

to invest significant resources into increasing the qualifications of their staff. So, 50% of the respondents

surveyed consider seminars and trainings to be a good way of improving skills of their employees.


The main difficulties connected with the supply of goods to a retail outlet are frequent disruptions of deliveries

and instability in the price and quality of the goods supplied. Instability of deliveries is a notable barrier for

31% of the respondents surveyed; unsteadiness of quality is a difficulty for 40% and frequent price increase

for the goods supplied is a significant problem for 50% of the retailers surveyed.



3.1.      Administrative Barriers


3.1.1.    Registration of a Business Entity


The first step the investor should take is to register his or her firm's presence in Ukraine. For a retail business

the best possible option is registering a representative office or a resident company (Joint-Stock or Limited

Liability Company).




________________________________________________________________________

18See Annex 8. All statistical data in this chapter are based on the research of Ukrainian Marketing Group (UMG) on administrative

and operational barriers facing retailers.




                                                                  35

Principally, the Law of Ukraine On Entrepreneurship governs the process of company registration19. The

amount of the registration fee and terms of registration are established by the government. In theory, the

process of company registration is not complicated and takes about a month, but as the survey respondents

admitted, this process can take significantly longer.


The registration process can be divided into 3 stages:
        pre-registration procedures;
        registration procedures;
        post-registration procedures.


Pre-registration procedures consist of gathering all necessary papers (founding documents, documents

certifying the legal address of the company) and notarizing them for registration purposes. How long this takes

depends on whether the investor decides to do all the work on his own or to apply to a corresponding partner

for assistance. Usually preparation of the documents prior to submission takes over a month.


Registration procedures involve addition of the start-up funds to the temporary banking account and finally, the

submission of all required registration documents to the local State Administration. As a result, the company

obtains its State Registration Certificate. According to the Law, after the full package of documents is

submitted, it should take no more than 7 working days to obtain a Registration Certificate, but based on the

experience of the respondents surveyed this process takes a week or two longer.


After obtaining the State Registration Certificate, the investor has to complete post-registration procedures for

the company. These include registration of the company with such institutions as the State Statistics

Department, Pension Fund, Unemployment Insurance Fund, Accident Insurance Fund, Temporary Disability

Fund, State Tax Administration and the local representation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.


Post-registration procedures also entail opening a permanent bank account.

The expected duration of the stage is about 25 days.


Taking into account the complexity of the registration process, most foreign companies choose to hire legal

service firms or local experts to carry out all paper work connected with registration.


The official registration fee in Ukraine is about USD 30. However, if a business-owner decides to speed up the

process and applies for assistance, registration can cost him up to ten times this amount.


Based on research data, registration procedures turned out to be a major obstacle only for 1,3 % of the

respondents. But as for foreign companies, it is preferable to apply for assistance of local experts.


3.1.2.   Permitting procedures


An investor can choose a number of potential methods of site selection, and the complexity of obtaining

permits and approvals from the state authorities will depend greatly on the company's decision of where and

how to situate the planned supermarket. The most common options are considered below, these are:


     1. new (green-field) construction

     2. rent of the premises/building and further reconstruction

     3. purchase of the premises/building and further reconstruction

Research data show that 55% of the respondents chose to rent a building, 30% purchased, and only 10% of

the respondents opted for green-field construction on a chosen site.


If a company chooses the first option  green-field construction, the process of obtaining permits and
approvals can be conditionally divided into 3 stages20:


      1). Obtaining a Land Tenure Certificate (document that certifies plot possession right).

      2). Obtaining permits for designing and construction phases, start-up of the newly constructed building

          and finally obtaining Facility Technical Passport.

      3). Obtaining Trading Activity Permit and License for Alcohol and Tobacco Trade (documents that certify

          the right to carry out trading activities).

It should be admitted that the process of obtaining permits is essentially the same for the other two options i.e.

rent or purchase of the premises/building and further repairs / reconstruction.



   If a plot is state or communal property, there are two ways to make it available for development  rent and

   permanent land tenure.

   Rent gives the company the right to finalize a long-term rent agreement (up to 50 years, for large sites this

   term is usually 15-25 years). But the major disadvantage is instability of rates.

   Permanent land tenure provides for land perpetuity, when the company is to pay only land tax as a

   landowner. However this is a conditional property (plot can't be sold), since the company obtained only

   tenure rights, but didn't buy it.

   Prospects: Regardless of the chosen way (rent or permanent land tenure), the company reserves the right
   to buy the occupied territory (plot)21. But in practice further sale of the plot to another legal entity is

   impossible.

    1). Obtaining a Land Tenure Certificate is a rather complicated procedure. It is a multi-step and time-
    consuming process.


    A Land Tenure Certificate is the document that certifies the rights of a natural person or legal entity to use
    the land.


    First of all it is necessary to get initial technical data, confirming that capital construction work can be
    carried out on the chosen plot site. In order to get a permission to carry out development and survey
    works, the company should apply to the City Administration.

    The City Administration shall hand over this application to the appropriate authorities. They will further
    certify that no other construction is planned on the chosen plot site and that a trade object  supermarket -
    can be built there.

    A positive response to the application is a permission-letter, issued by the City Administration. After the
    company obtains it, it can begin the process of initial development and survey works.

     According to the research for this report, only 10% of Ukrainian retailers considered this procedure as a
    significant barrier, similarly 39% of the respondents claimed that it was not a difficulty at all.

    Initial technical data is the basis for the future design of the supermarket. The main problem here is to
    obtain technical requirements for utilities (sewage, water supply etc.) from the appropriate authorities, and
    to obtain the architectural-planning assignment and conclusions of fire inspection, state road police
    department and sanitary authority.

    After the necessary documents are available, the City Council makes the final decision on land allotment.
    If it is positive, it is necessary to make a geodesic and geological survey of the plot and to develop the
    land allotment design. The Land Authority (city level) will develop a land allotment design and further
    include the plot in the Land Cadastre. As a result of these procedures a land reservation contract between
    the company and the City Council will be drawn up.

    The process of land allotment is considered a serious obstacle barrier by 25% of surveyed retailers.

    After obtaining the land reservation contract, it is possible to start development of the design of the future
    site. For this reason a design company (contractor) is selected, whose responsibility it is to develop and to
    get approval for the design of the future building. The main barriers are expertise by the state committee
    and obtaining final approval from the City Design Council.

    Authorities issuing permits may in some cases unofficially dictate which contractor for design and
    construction works to choose - otherwise additional problems with obtaining permissions may arise.
    Usually this is done for the purpose of promoting state designing and construction institutions.

    Since the development of the building design is the task of a design company, for the majority of retailers
    this process did not cause any troubles (for 63% of the respondents said it was either not a minor
    obstacle). Design approval procedures turned out to be no problem for 34% of respondents, while 13%
    said it was a significant difficulty.

    It should be noted, that it is impossible to obtain the Land Tenure Certificate without development and
    approval of the design. So, division of the process of obtaining permits and approvals into stages is
    conditional.


    After the City Design Council approves design documentation, the company needs to pay an
    infrastructure development fee, which should not exceed 25% of the estimated cost of the project22. The

                fee amount (portion of 25% of the estimated cost) is to be negotiated and agreed upon with Economic
                Authority of the City State Administration.


                Finally, the investor applies to the City Council and requests plot use / possession rights. If the Council
                approves, the final step is to obtain a Land Tenure Statement from the Land Authority.


                The process of obtaining a Land Tenure Certificate is very time-consuming: based on practical experience
                it can take about a year.

           At the same time in Ukraine different measures are taken to make the above-mentioned procedures less

           complicated. Thus, recently in the city of Cherkasy the mayor's office has simplified the procedure for land

           allotment, reconstruction of premises and obtaining permits for opening retail outlets. The city has created a

           special unified commission which includes representatives from such authorities as the city architecture

           department, land resources department, city sanitary epidemiological station, state fire prevention department,

           state department on ecology and natural resources, department for labor supervision, and Cherkasy City

           Council's department for coordination of entrepreneurship development.




                                                                            39

2). Obtaining permits for design and construction works, start-up of the newly constructed building

     and obtaining the Facility Technical Passport is another important step.


     The Facility Technical Passport is the document that validates the owner of the facility and specifies the

     technical characteristics of a building.


     After the design documentation is approved, the company must obtain a permit and an order for

     construction. The State Architectural and Construction Committee issues these documents. The

     company-investor should obtain the permit for construction works, while its contractor (construction

     company)  the order for construction works.


     As key retailers say, if all necessary documentation for construction is available, cooperation with state

     authorities at the stage of the process will not cause particular problems (of course, given that all

     construction work is carried out in accordance with Ukrainian standards).


     After completion of construction work, the final step is start-up and commissioning. Based on the sample,

     this stage turned to be quite difficult for 55% of the respondents. The procedure is as follows.


     The State Architectural and Construction Committee appoints a staff of experts, who carry out an

     examination of the newly constructed building. As a result, the State Committee Statement is issued.

     Finally, on the basis of this Statement, the facility (building) is to be registered with the Technical Inventory

     Bureau, which shall issue the Facility Technical Passport.


3). Obtaining Trading Activity Permit and License for Alcohol and Tobacco Trade is the final step.


     To start trading activity a Trading Activity Permit is required. It does not take much time to obtain this
     permit, as all the company should do this to submit a number of certain documents (i.e. registration and
     foundation documents, approval of goods assortment, rent agreement or property certificate) to the Trade
     Department of the City Executive Committee.


     If the Trade Activity Permit is obtained, the retailer can apply to the appropriate authority for the License
     for Alcohol and Tobacco Trade23.


     The process of obtaining permissions to carry out trading activities is the same regardless of how the
     supermarket location is procured.


If the investor decides to choose to rent the premises/building and further reconstruction, the process of
obtaining permits for designing and (re-)construction phases would be almost the same as for green-field
construction. The difference is that in this case there are significantly fewer land property issues to be
considered what considerably speeds up the process.

The procedure will also be simplified if the functions of the newly rented building are not changed as well as if
no reconstruction takes place. However, it is extremely difficult to find such buildings, as most have already
been rented. Research results show that finding an appropriate building for store location was a barrier for
nearly half of the respondents -- 43%. At the same time, the issue of high and unstable rent rates created
difficulties for 29% of the respondents.

   The process of purchasing of the premises/building and further reconstruction consists of the following.

   For the investor is essential to obtain building and land property rights. So, on the basis of the sale/purchase

   contract, the Technical Inventory Bureau shall include personal data of the new owner in the Facility Technical

   Passport. After that, the new owner needs to apply to the Land Authority for the transfer of land tenure rights.

   This application is handed over to and must be approved by the City Council. Based on this approval, the

   Land Authority can issue a Land Tenure Certificate to the new owner.

   The graph below shows how retailers evaluate difficulties connected with purchasing a building/ premises.

The investor should take into account the significant time and cost differentials of the three options. While the

process of renting or purchasing a premises/building and reconstruction will take not less than 3 months,

green-field construction will last not less than a year.


According to the results of the marketing research, the best methods of cooperation with state authorities are:


             professionally developed documentation (74% of the respondents)
             personal contacts with state officials (52%)
             use of different incentives for officials (51%)



3.1.3.   Ukrainian legislation on retail. Sanitary regulations and certification of food products


In Ukraine the food retail sector is governed by:


 The law Concerning the quality and safety of food products and raw materials for food industry

It establishes legal principles for providing quality and health safe food products and raw materials for food

industry, and regulates relations between executive authorities, producers, sellers (suppliers) and consumers

during production, import, purchase, delivery, storage, transportation, consumption and utilization of food

products and raw materials for the food industry.


 The law Concerning the provision of sanitary and epidemic welfare of the population

It regulates social relations originating in the sphere of provision for sanitary and epidemic welfare, determines

appropriate rights and obligations of state authorities, enterprises, institutions, organizations and citizens, and

establishes the way of organization of the state sanitary and epidemic service and inspection in Ukraine.


The law Concerning the protection of consumer rights

It regulates relations between consumers of goods (works, services) and producers, establishes consumer

rights and determines the mechanism of realization and state protection of these rights.


The order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Concerning the approval of the rules of trade in foodstuffs24

These rules regulate the procedure of acceptance, storage, preparation for trade and trade in foodstuffs

through a retail network and also determine requirements for observance of consumer rights concerning

quality and safety of goods and trade service.


   In February 2003 the Council of Entrepreneurs under the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers began to develop

   the draft of a new law Concerning trade chains in Ukraine. This law should provide for equal principles of

   competition between domestic retail chains and big foreign retail trade companies. As a basis for this draft

   law a similar law adopted in Poland was analyzed.

According to research for this report, 34% of the respondents consider instability of Ukrainian legislation to be

a significant barrier for their business activities.


  For example, in Ukraine there are no legal documents that regulate the functioning of cash and carry type

  stores. At the same time, some supermarket chains practice retail and wholesale trade simultaneously,

  which is not provided for by Ukrainian legislation on retail.


One of the main requirements for the supermarkets is quality and safety of the products sold.


According to the law of Ukraine Concerning the quality and safety of food products and raw materials for the

food industry, food products, raw materials for food industry and related materials may not be imported into

Ukraine or produced, supplied for sale, sold or used otherwise before their quality and safety have been

approved by appropriate documents. These documents are:


             a declaration of conformity issued by the producer for every consignment of food products, raw

              materials for food industry and related materials; or alternatively
             a certificate of conformity or a certificate of acceptance of a foreign certificate, issued by an

              accredited authority for food products intended for sale on a domestic market, or for

              domestically produced food products to be exported from Ukraine; as well as the following

              documents:
             a positive conclusion of the State Sanitary  Epidemiological Expertise, a state registration

              certificate or a hygiene certificate.
             veterinary documents for food products of animal origin;
             a certificate of quality and a guarantee permit for grain, fruit and vegetables.


Suppliers of food products to Ukrainian supermarkets are responsible for providing the above-mentioned

documents.


Another possible barrier that a company can face is cooperation with fire inspection, sanitary authorities and

authorities for protection of consumer rights. According to the marketing research, these 3 authorities carry out

inspections most frequently: in 2002 fire inspection and sanitary authority carried out inspections in 95% of the

supermarkets surveyed; similarly authorities on protection of consumer rights in 88%.


Difficulties are also connected with the fact that primarily the assortment list of a supermarket must be

approved by the sanitary authorities and, based on practical experience, this can take up to several weeks.


Another problem is that the law of Ukraine Concerning the Protection of Consumer Rights gives oversight

power to the Committee for Protection of Consumer Rights. As a result, a retailer is not protected against

unreasonable claims or requirements for the products sold.


For example, a requirement of the Committee for Protection of Consumer Rights to one local retailer was to

mark each banana with a label containing complete information about the product.

3.2.       Operational barriers


3.2.1.     Infrastructure


Product transportation, heat, water and power supply as well as communications are infrastructure issues

which greatly influence the operations of a retail store. Many Ukrainian retailers have already faced difficulties

connected with undeveloped infrastructure.


Prompt deliveries to supermarkets depend on proper transportation of goods. In Ukraine, transportation of

goods is mainly by railway and automobile, and as admitted by most retailers, neither way is always reliable.

For example, the average delay in delivery required by suppliers who use railway is at least two weeks. An

additional problem with railway transport is poor quality of transportation means (wagons); as a result it is

difficult to keep goods undamaged.


Poor quality of highways is a major obstacle for 36% of responding Ukrainian retailers. Another barrier is the

poor quality of the vehicles used for road transportation (i.e. trucks, refrigerating vans etc). The owners of

good-quality trucks prefer to transport internationally, as this is a more profitable business than domestic

transport operations. As a result, inland transportation of goods is carried out mainly by outdated vehicles. All

of this causes irregularity of supplies as well as damage of transported goods.


Based on research results, non-systematic water supply causes much trouble for 37% of the respondents.

41% of retailers/respondents have faced problems connected with the instability of the power supply.


High-quality telephone communication can also be a problem, especially when a retail outlet is situated on the

outskirts  this was a serious barrier for 23% of retailers surveyed.




3.2.2.     Trade equipment and software


There are many firms on the Ukrainian market offering high-quality equipment for supermarkets. Equipment

suppliers say that the layout of the supermarket is a key factor influencing the choice of equipment, since it

takes into account such specific features as store format, target group of consumers, ratio of assortment

groups etc. A properly developed layout will help both to save money when equipment is purchased and to

increase future profits.


The best way for a retailer to proceed is to select and locate trade equipment items according to the

appropriate design of the refrigerating, heating, ventilation and conditioning systems.


According to preliminary calculations made by several equipment suppliers, the average cost of a minimum

required set of refrigerators and shelves for a supermarket with an area of about 1 thousand square meters, is

USD 200,000-250,000.



Another important issue is the purchase of second-hand equipment for trade. While the main advantage of this

is a considerably lower price, all key Ukrainian retailers admitted that purchase of second-hand refrigerating

and freezing equipment is a significant mistake on the part of an investor. At the same time, investors can

greatly benefit from the purchase of second-hand supermarket shelves.

3.2.3.    Human resource issues


Presently Ukrainian supermarkets, especially big chains, lack qualified personnel. This applies to employees

occupying various positions, both managerial and non-managerial supermarket staff. For 38% and 13% of the

respondents, lack of qualified personnel was correspondingly a significant and a major barrier. Of

respondents, 27% faced significant difficulties while selecting managerial staff, similarly 30% - while selecting

trade personnel.

Another problem involves the use of automated computer systems. The main advice of Ukrainian storeowners

is to employ PC literate people and further teach them.


In general, high employee turnover was an obstacle for 43% of respondents.


Statistic data proves that the quantity of personnel per 1 m2 in Ukrainian supermarkets is 3 times higher

than in Europe.


According to the information provided by several Ukrainian retailers, the average number of employees
needed for a 1,000 m2 supermarket with 8 cash terminals is about 100. At the same time the number of
employees of one of the biggest Ukrainian hypermarkets (7000 m2, 36 cash terminals) is 240.


Of course, if a supermarket has its own production workshops (i.e. meat and cookery departments, mini-

bakeries) as well as warehouses, the number of employees will increase. Delivery schedule and working

hours of the supermarket are also key factors.


According to official statistics provided by the Ukrainian State Statistics Committee, the average salary in

wholesale and retail in December 2002 was UAH 376 (USD 70). However, retailers say that the average

salary of supermarket employees is about UAH 400-500 (USD 80  100).


Of survey respondents, 42% said that high salary fund charges hamper significantly the salary increase of

the employees.



3.2.4.   Supply of goods / Assortment


Assortment policy of any supermarket is ruled by such main factors as:
        Format of the supermarket
        Income level of target consumer groups


Usually assortment is determined by taking into account the needs of different consumer categories  with

high, average, and low income levels. At the same time, every supermarket makes decisions on the extension

or shrinkage of certain groups of goods on the basis of sales analysis. Usually the assortment offered by

Ukrainian retailers ranges from 8,000 to 25,000 items.


Having analyzed sales volume, most Ukrainian retailers came to the conclusion that 80% of their profit is

earned by 20% of assortment (approximately 4,500  5,000 items). Companies therefore practice regular

stock screening in order to withdraw unprofitable items from their assortment.


The optimal volume of deliveries and number of assortment items is defined during trade activity of the

supermarket. Based on practical experience, a retailer will need at least USD 100,000 for the primary

purchase of goods. This amount must be enough for trial consignments of the main assortment groups.


Purchasing decision for supermarkets chains is made and contracts are signed by managers from the central

office, but local store managers usually organize the supply of perishable goods. In each store there are

category managers that control their merchandise groups.




                                                      46

Practice shows that many Western supermarket chains join efforts in order to establish common distribution

centers. These centers provide for centralized purchasing and distribution of goods among supermarkets.

Ukrainian retail sector is not developed enough yet, so this way of arranging supplies remains a prospective

one.


To provide for proper deliveries for a classic-style supermarket about 200-300 suppliers are necessary.

Cooperation with them is the task of purchase/category managers who make sure that certain products are

available in the store.


The following difficulties connected with cooperation with suppliers proved to be serious obstacles for

Ukrainian retailers:
        Bad quality of goods' packing (38%);
        Unavailability of all required documents for the goods (37%);
        Incorrect work of category managers while choosing suppliers (33%);
        Limited possibilities for returning unsold goods to the supplier (32%).


Food products with long-term shelf lives are usually delivered to the stores once a week. In those

supermarkets, where customers' flow is very high, deliveries can be done twice a week.


Some stores practice `just in time' delivery and do not have any storage area. However, due to delivery

problems, which can occur at any stage, it is preferable to have at least 1-2 days inventory stock.


Among the main problems of supply of goods, managers of Ukrainian supermarkets cite instability of

deliveries and non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by suppliers. This especially concerns imported

products. This is why if shelf life of `problematic' imported goods is long enough, it is often better to keep larger

stocks.


Most Ukrainian supermarkets are faced with difficulties connected with the instability of supplies of fruits and

vegetables. In Ukraine there is no organized market infrastructure for trade of fresh fruits and vegetables. The

estimated amount of investment needed for its set up is USD 70-80 mn.


The problems caused by irregularity and disruption of deliveries are demonstrated by research results:

disruption of deliveries is a barrier for 43% of the respondents. A similar situation exists with non-fulfillment of

contractual obligations: for 38% this was a notable obstacle.




3.2.5.   Customs


Obtaining imported goods is quite risky for all supermarkets, as complex custom procedures and the process

of re-certification of imported goods (obtaining Ukrainian certificates) often result in delays or even disruption

of deliveries.


High import duty rates cause significant troubles for 30% of Ukrainian retailers/respondents. The Table 11

below gives information on import duty rates for major foodstuffs.

Since supermarkets purchase only officially imported goods, their costs are increased in comparison with

illegally imported ones. Correspondingly, prices for imported goods offered by retail stores are less

competitive than those offered by local street markets.

   Law `On Customs Tariff of Ukraine' of 5/04/2001 No. 2371-III




                                                               48

3.2.6.   Financing of retail


To open a supermarket, significant investments are needed. The most common sources of external capital for

starting a retail business are:


        venture capital funds
        international financial institutions
        Ukrainian and foreign commercial banks


The task of a venture capital fund is to provide companies operating in the fastest growing sectors with capital

and the necessary management tools to further evolve them from entrepreneurial ventures into professionally

managed companies. Investments are made when a venture fund is convinced that significant return on

capital commensurate with the inherent risks will be realized. Usually venture funds aim to realize capital gains

on its investments in four to six years.



The leading venture funds functioning in Ukraine are Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF) (capitalization

USD150 mn) and Sigma Bleyzer (more than USD 100 mn). Other venture funds, such as Euroventures

Ukraine and Commercial Capital operate with lower amounts  about USD 20-40 mn each.


Examples of successful investments in the Ukrainian retail sector made by venture funds are those of

WNISEF and Commercial Capital (Euromart Cash & Carry chain) and of Euroventures (Furshet supermarket

chain).


Loans given by international financial institutions such as the World Bank Group and the European Bank for

Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are another source of financing of the retail sector.



For example, the EBRD, starting in 2003, intends to implement a project aimed at expanding the retail

operations of Billa supermarkets in Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania by providing long-term debt financing.


The estimated total project cost for the three countries is EUR 202 million, of this amount EBRD is providing

long-term loans worth EUR 45 million.


Proceeds will be used to finance construction and operation of the supermarkets in the three countries over

the next 3-4 years. It is expected that the project will support the development of a modern food retail industry

in the region by expanding a high quality and high standard chain of supermarkets. This project would

increase efficiency and competition in the market as well as lead to positive developments in the supply chain,

including the development of know-how skills.


Ukrainian and foreign commercial banks can also provide retailers with necessary financial resources. On the

average, annual bank interest is 25-27% for loans in UAH and 15-16% for loans in USD. But there are cases

when interest rates are lower. For example, the annual interest of a Polish bank financing a loan to the

Ukrainian company Intermarket (Lviv) was 5%.


According to the research, frequent changes of bank interest rates are a significant barrier for 20% of the

respondents responding Ukrainian retailers.

4.        Regional Overview


The overview presents brief and the most essential information on each oblast / large city of Ukraine. The data
shown give, in our opinion, sufficient background for evaluation of regional specifics, and provide ground for
comparison and decision-making.


Problems with obtaining specific data for each city occurr because most statistics are kept on a regional (and
not on a city) level. For this reason, at the beginning of this chapter regional developments are described by
oblast (tables and figures are presented in Annex 10). They are followed by information on the major cities.


Useful site: http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/ - State Statistics Committee of Ukraine




4.1.      Regional Development


Population income and expenditures
Official statistics on household income and expenditures are presented in Figure A.10.1 (see Annex 10). It is a
curious fact that expenditures exceed income in several oblasts of Ukraine. This can be explained by the large
share of shadow economy in these regions. Most considerable discrepancy is marked in Kyiv city, Odesa,
Kharkiv, Lviv, Chernivtsi, Volyn oblasts and the Crimea.


In terms of absolute value, Kyiv is the leader again both in income and expenditures. It enjoys more than a 3-
fold advantage over other regions.


Urbanization
Though 67% of all Ukrainian citizens live in urban areas, the level of urbanization of each oblast varies from 37
to 90%, depending on the oblast (see Figure A.10.2, Annex 10). The highest level of urbanization is observed
in the oblasts where the largest cities are located. Such industrial oblasts as Donetsk, Luhansk and
Dnipropetrovsk are most urbanized. They are followed by Kyiv oblast. The share of rural population in these
oblasts ranges from 10 to 17%.


The lowest percentage of urban population is registered in such oblasts as Zakarpattia, Chernivtsi, Ivano-
Frankivsk, Ternopil, Vinnytsia and Rivne, where there are no large cities. In these oblasts rural population
prevails, and its share makes up from 53% in Rivne oblast to 63% in Zakarpattia.


Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)27
Distribution of FDI across Ukraine's regions is uneven (see Figure A.10.3, Annex 10). It is related to the
difference in the economic development of oblasts. Thus, Kyiv city, Republic of Crimea and 7 major large
industrial oblasts have attracted 76% of total FDI as of 1 January 2002, or USD 4.4 bn.


The Ukrainian capital Kyiv maintains its leading position in terms of attraction of foreign investments. It takes
first place among all oblasts of Ukraine with USD 1.5 bn (35% of total FDI).


________________________________________________________________________


   27  All data presented in this section (except for retail) describes the situation in oblasts as of 1 January 2002 (though

     macroeconomic overview presents data as of 1 January 2003). However, in contrast to macroeconomic data, regional

     investment statistics are collected on an annual basis only and results are announced in the spring of the next year.

     Unfortunately, results of 2002 are still not available.




                                                               50

As of 1 January 2002 the amount of USD 91 per capita had been invested into the Ukrainian economy
(USD 111 per capita as of 1 January 2003). Kyiv is also leading in this respect with USD 583 per capita (see
Figure A.10.4, Annex 10). The Ukrainian capital is followed by Kyiv oblast where USD 192 was attracted per
capita. Third place is taken by Zaporizhia oblast (USD 129 per capita), followed by Odesa and Poltava (USD
96 and 90 respectively).


Retail sector

Analysis of the regional retail (food and non-food) indicators in 2002 (see Table A.10.1, Annex 10) allows
drawing the following conclusions:

         Kyiv city, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Lviv oblasts are the leaders in terms of retail turnover:

         The highest turnover per capita was registered in Kyiv city, followed by Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and

         Lviv oblasts. Similarly, the highest density of retail outlets is marked in Chernihiv and Lviv oblasts (29

         and 26 outlets per 10,000 inhabitants), while in Kyiv the density is the lowest in Ukraine (14 outlets);

         The best availability of sales areas appeared to be in Sevastopil city and Chernihiv oblast (1,941 and
         1,737 m2 per 10,000 inhabitants). In Kyiv this indicator is a bit lower - 1,701 m2 per 10,000 inhabitants.

Estimated food retail turnover in 2002 in Ukraine totals USD 13 bn, or UAH 70.7 bn (estimates are based on

the share of food purchases in expenditures of population). Similarly, annual food retail turnover per capita is

estimated at USD 274, or UAH 1,460.


Though estimated food retail turnover per oblast is the highest in Donetsk (USD 1.13 bn) and Dnipropetrovsk

(USD 1.11 bn), absolute value per capita reaches the highest level in Odesa region (USD 338). In addition, in

such oblasts as Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, Crimea, Lviv, Donetsk, Poltava and Mykolaiv food retail

turnover per capita is around the average value.


Kyiv city has a special status in this regard: food retail turnover per capita is estimated at almost USD 1,125 (or

UAH 6,000). At the same time, in Kyiv oblast food retail turnover per capita amounts to USD 207.

Breakdown by oblast is presented in Figure 24.

       Supermarkets31

                 There were more than 55 food supermarkets in the city as of March 2003. Their number almost
                 doubled in 2002.

                 Supermarket sales vary from 8 to 15% of Kyiv's retail turnover in 2002 (retailers' estimates). The
                 pessimistic forecast for the next five years  an increase in supermarkets share up to 20-25%.

       According to food producers' estimate, the share of supermarkets in Kyiv's food retail sector grew rapidly: from

       5-7% in 2001 to 19% in 2002. Their forecast for 2003 is up to 31%.

                 Retail gross margin in Kyiv supermarkets - 15 to 20% on average.

                 Space is available for rent at the price up to USD 100 per 1 m2, and for purchase  starting at USD
                 400 per 1 m2 (depending on location, total area and state of premises).

 Major players



 Among more than 50 food supermarkets operating in the Kyiv market only few are independent.


 During 2001-2002 the first Kyiv supermarket chains were created and developed. Thus, Fozzy Group operating

 Silpo supermarkets and Garantiya-Trade with its Furshet stores increased the number of their outlets in the

 Ukrainian capital to 17 and 12 respectively. Presently both of them plan another wave of expansion that will

 result in more than 20 stores in each chain.


 The leaders are followed by Kviza Trade (Velyka Kyshenia chain), Megamarket, Billa, Spar and others.

        City development plan envisions reconstruction of old and opening of new trade outlets

 Based on the information of the Kyiv City State Administration, Kyiv government does not, for the time being,

 sell land to foreigners, but only to companies with foreign investments. In particular, Kyiv sold several land plots

 to McDonald's Corporation Ukraine for the construction of fast-food restaurants, as well as 2 land plots to Billa-

 Ukraine for construction of supermarkets.

                                                                 54

       On 26 February 2003, Kyiv authorities announced that Metro Cash & Carry had bought a 6-hectares' land plot

       for its store. City budget expects to receive UAH 18 mn (about USD 3.4 mn) from this deal. Metro has already

       made an advance payment in the amount of 15% of the total cost.


              Local players have no fear of international retailers entering the market. They feel that the market is still

              capable of supporting them all. For example, forecasted customer outflow from Kyiv's supermarkets with

              Metro opening is up to 5%.

              Though pricing policies of chains differ, the consumer will pay almost the same amount (for the same

              product set) in any supermarket. The difference is usually less than UAH 1 (USD 20 cents). This is

              explained by the fact that Kyiv chains try to keep purchase prices (prices at which supermarkets buy from

              suppliers) similar for all outlets in the city.

              Kyiv consumers are characterized by higher incomes when compared to customers in the regions, and

              demand for quality services and a stable assortment of products. The former is the major reason why

              retailers do not influence customers with discounts and other motivational means.

              High season in food retail: traditional national and religious holidays, City Day, some professional

              holidays.

 4.2.2.    Kharkiv


 Though there are a few strong local retail chains that are rapidly developing, Kharkiv can offer good

 opportunities for investments in the retail sector as the market is far from satiety. However, such characteristics

 as close location to the Russian border, relatively low income of population and low level of retail prices are to

 be considered.

 Supermarkets35

           There are about 30 food supermarkets in the city.

           % Supermarkets / Other Retail Outlets - 5-7 %.

           Retail gross margin in supermarkets is quite low and ranges from 15 to 20% depending on retail chain.
           Space is available for purchase at appr. USD 300 per 1 m2, and for rent  USD 6-20 per 1 m2

           (depending on location).


 Major players


 Both local, regional and national companies have established their presence in Kharkiv's food retail market.

 The local leaders are Klass and ROST. Target has developed its chain also in Sumy and Poltava, and Brig  in

 Zaporizhia. Billa and Euromart also located their outlets in Kharkiv, but their business is less successful than

 that of Kharkiv-based retailers.

 Each Kharkiv-based chain is planning its development in 2003, and it can be assumed that several new
 supermarkets and even hypermarkets will soon appear in the city.


 According to recent information from local authorities, 4 new supermarkets (ROST, Klass and 2 Target
 shopping centers) will open in Kharkiv in 2003. Their construction has already started.


 Consumers

          Average daily number of purchases in one supermarket  4,500 - 5,000

          Average bill (supermarkets only)  UAH 79 (USD 15)

          Frequency of going to supermarkets  9 times per month

          Way of getting to supermarket  34% - on foot; 31% - by own car, 32% - by public transport


 Local characteristics

        The food retail market is not saturated. Local retailers (such as Target, Klass, ROST) are developing and

        receive support from local authorities.

        Local consumers are very price sensitive. Kharkiv has always been considered an industrial center with

        well-developed machinery and aircraft engineering as well as a scientific-and-educational center, but

        salaries in these sectors are relatively low and are not paid regularly.

        Retail outlets, which are smaller than supermarkets, are also developing their chains. In this segment of

        food retail, such companies as Argo Trading House and Kharkiv-Moscow can be mentioned. Both of

        these companies have production facilities and retail outlets. Argo has 25 food shops in the city and sells

        mainly its own brands (alcohol, tea, mineral water and lemonade, meat products, cereals, macaroni),

        while Kharkiv-Moscow owns a chain of 50 kiosks and bakery shops and sells its own bread and bakery

        products.

        High season in food retail: traditional national and religious holidays, City Day, professional holidays

        (Frontier Guard Day, Paratrooper Day)

 Customers' flow was distributed unevenly on the New Year eve. Some supermarkets (like ROST and Klass)

 had to let in only client cardholders.

 Major players

 As of the beginning of 2003 there were about 70 supermarkets, and the plans of companies were to increase

 this number to 100 within the next couple of years.

 Dnipropetrovsk's food market (supermarket segment only) is shared by major retailers: Rainford (5

 supermarkets, 1 discounter, 3 cash and carry), ATB-Market (about 40 discounters), Fozzy-Ost (7 Silpo

 supermarkets).

 Other retailers operating in Dnipropetrovsk include Billa (2 supermarkets), Pik (food supermarket and

 household goods stores), Euromart (1 cash & carry store) - their market share in the supermarket segment is

 relatively low.

Recently the largest supermarket Terra (sales area  7,550 m2) was opened in Dnipropetrovsk by one of the
companies of Olvia Corporation (which unites production, construction and trading companies). Construction
lasted 8 months and cost of 1 m2 was estimated at USD 600-800 (planned payback period  5 years). The
supermarket is designed for simultaneous shopping of up to 25,000 customers.


Consumers

           Average daily number of purchases in one supermarket  5,000 - 6,000
           Average bill (supermarkets only)  UAH 51 (USD 10)
           Frequency of going to supermarkets  12-13 times per month
           Way of getting to supermarket  54% - on foot; 24% - by own car, 21% - by public transport


Local characteristics

     The city food retail market is relatively saturated and due to the presence of large chains the level of
     competition in retail is high at the moment. Availability of sales area in 2001 (both food and non-food) was
     469 m2 per 1,000 inhabitants (over 200% of the one-time `Soviet' norm).

     The retail sector has undergone a balanced development during the last decade. Following the period
     when small-scale retail outlets had gained high popularity, the period of retail consolidation started.
     Investments in the trade sector made up 33.6% of total investments in city industry and infrastructure. It
     should be noted also that the first Ukrainian supermarket was opened in Dnipropetrovsk in 1995 by
     Rainford Group.

     During the last 2-3 years open markets have lost their importance as the main source of food supplies.
     Quality of food and level of service became the key criteria for changes in the population's preferences.

     Development of own retail chains of food producers: Dnipropetrovsk Confectionery  6 shops,
     Dnipropetrovsk Oil Extraction Plant (Oleyna brand), Beriozka Meat Factory and Yubileyny Meat Plant,
     bakeries.

Rainford Group is presently expanding a chain of small-scale retail outlets of sales area about 30m2 (under
`Korzinka' brand) where it sells foodstuffs produced by companies it controlls.

        High season in food retail: traditional national and religious holidays, City Day, professional holidays
        (Metallurgist Day)

        Special attention can be paid to the development of retail in the other towns of Dnipropetrovsk oblast
        (Kryvy Rig, Nikopol, Dniprodzerzhinsk, Zhovti Vody)

 Supermarkets44

          There are about 30 food supermarkets in the city45

          Share of supermarkets in food retail turnover  about 10-15%

          Retail gross margin in supermarkets is 15-20% on average (with a downtrend)
          Food retail sales space is available for rent at appr. USD 15-25 per 1 m2. ; non-food  USD 30-45 per 1
          m2 ; warehouse space is leased at the price of USD 3-5 per 1 m2. Space is available for purchase at
          USD 200-300 per 1 m2


 Major players

 The level of supermarket consolidation in Odesa is one of the highest in Ukraine. There are about 30 large
 stores and many smaller outlets (but still competive by turnover).

 According to local experts, leadership in retail belongs to Tavriya V, Rorus and Fortuna Trade House (one of
 the largest distribution companies in South Ukraine trading through Ideal cash & carry). All of these companies
 have more than 8 years' experience in the trade business. Large food producer and distributor, Almi Concern,
 is also a retail operator with its own Kopeyka chain (4 stores).

 Fozzy Group has considerable expansion plans in Odesa: a total of 8 outlets are going to be opened under
 Silpo brand. Currently, Fozzy hypermarket and 2 Silpo operate there.

Chains of mini-markets like Robin-Bobin (sales area of a store is around 100 m2) and Obzhora have recently
gained popularity. Robin-Bobins have a good assortment and are considered to be shops for wealthy
consumers.

In the opinion of some local retailers, 2-3 supermarkets would be enough to saturate the market.

Consumers
           Average daily number of purchases in one supermarket  3,000  4,000
           Average bill (supermarkets only)  UAH 64 (USD 12)

           Way of getting to supermarket  42% - on foot; 27% - by own car, 30% - by public transport


Local characteristics

     Though Odesa is a maritime city located at the intersection of shipping routes and functioning as the
     largest transport-cargo terminal in South Ukraine, it is to a certain extent closed for external businesses
     wishing to enter its market. For example, Billa-Ukraine has failed to open its supermarket in Odesa.

     Starting from 1998, city authorities have maintained a support strategy for the development of retail, public
     catering, hotel and entertainment infrastructure. Due to this support, the sector has undergone rapid
     growth and continues its further development.

     Level of competition in retail is quite high. At the moment the aggravation of competition between retail
     chains and small retail outlets is observed (chains of 150-300 small-scale shops / kiosks are quite powerful
     in terms of turnover and influence on suppliers).

     As consumer preferences are shifting and people are no longer averse to going to modern stores, street
     markets are also facing competition from supermarkets (though influence of open markets is historically
     very high in Odesa).

     There is a deficit of affordable land plots in Odesa.

     High season in food retail: traditional national and religious holidays, City Day.

     Special attention can be paid to the development of retail in other towns of oblast (Illichivsk, Izmail,
     Bilgorod-Dnistrovsky). Illichivsk, located 15-20 km from Odesa's border, is considered one of the most
     promising territories. The town has 60,000 inhabitants with an average income of more than UAH 600
     (about USD 110) per capita.

 4.2.5.   Donetsk


 As the city is to a high extent closed for external businesses wishing to enter its market, retail development in

 Donetsk is slow versus other regions. Definitely, there is a niche for new retailers (income of population is high, and

 modern retail services are at a low level). However, investments are possible only with support of local authorities.

 Key statistics47:

          Area of the city  369 km2

          Number of districts (rayons)  9

          Population  1,016 thousand inhabitants

          Average monthly income in Donetsk oblast, per capita, 2001  USD 41 (UAH 219)

          Average salary in Donetsk was USD 87 (UAH 463) in 2002; for 2003 it is predicted at the level of

          USD 96 (UAH 510)  forecast of city authorities

 Retail development48:

          Total number of retail outlets in Donetsk oblast is 8,056 (including 5,899 stores)
          Average size of stores in Donetsk and towns of Donetsk oblast  121 m2

          Retail trade turnover in 2002 reached about USD 350 mn (23% increase compared to 2001)

          Planned growth of retail turnover for 2003 is 7.7%

 Supermarkets49

     There are 10 food supermarkets in the city

     % Supermarkets / Other Retail Outlets - 2-3 %

     Retail gross margin in supermarkets is high (not less than 20% on average)
     Space is available for purchase at USD 200-300 per m2, and construction with equipment costs about USD 500 per m2


 Major players

 As of the beginning of 2003 there are about 10 supermarkets. 5 of them belong to the only well-established

 retail chain Obzhora. Manufacturing company Sarepta owns 2 supermarkets in Donetsk and Makeevka

 (Donetsk oblast) and is constructing a second one in Donetsk.

 There are also a few independent supermarkets in the centre of Donetsk: Za Milykh Dam (To Dear Ladies)  2,

 and Maxim 1.

 Most of the stores are located in the city centre, and companies have begun to pay attention to residential
 areas only recently. Thus, Obzhora opened its 5th store in Tekstilschik residential district.

 Old-type gastronom (grocery store) chains are represented by Agrofirm Shakhtar of Zasiadka Mine and retail
 chain of Illicha Metalwork.

City authorities have recently announced the retail development plan for 2003. According to Donetsk's mayor
estimates51, 85 new retail outlets will be set up, including construction of 3 supermarkets (with sales area of more
than 3,000 m2 each) by a local investor. As it was declared, `such supermarkets have already been established in
Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and even in Luhansk. However, Donetsk lags behind in this respect'.

Most likely, the `local investor' is Donetskprodtorg wholesale company, which has recently built its own distribution center
and is expected to enter a supermarket market in spring - summer 2003 under Amstor brand (information not confirmed).

    Consumers

              Average daily number of purchases in one supermarket  2,000
              Average bill (supermarkets only)  UAH 84 (USD 16)
              Frequency of going to supermarkets  16 times per month
              Way of getting to supermarket  42% - on foot; 44% - by own car, 11% - by public transport

    Local characteristics

       The city is to a high extent closed for external businesses wishing to enter its market.

       Retail development has only started and Donetsk lags far behind other Ukrainian cities in this respect. Food
       retail coverage is poor (only 10 supermarkets for a city with more than 1 mn inhabitants). Free niches exist,
       especially in residential districts.

       There is only one well-established retailer in the supermarket sector: chain of Obzhora supermarkets with 5
       stores, 4 of them located in the city center and 1 (opened in December 2002)  in a residential area.

       There are no large stores in the city. Construction of the first hypermarket is a short-term plan of local retailers.

       City authorities approved the program `City without outskirts' aimed at the development of uptown areas. One
       of the goals of this program is to urge retailers to promote their business in the outlying districts of the city.

       High season in food retail: traditional national and religious holidays, City Day, professional holidays (Miner
       Day, Militia Day). Purchases of beverages and snacks increase also on the days when soccer games take
       place (there are two Donetsk-based soccer teams playing in Premier League).

    Obzhora supermarkets ran out of beverages and confectionery stocks after 2002 Militia Day (20 December).
    Most of the merchandise prepared for New Year high season was sold out. So the company's buyers had to
    obtain additional supplies urgently.

         Special attention can be paid to the development of retail in other towns of oblast (Yenakievo, Makeevka,
         Gorlovka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Mariupol), where retail has just started to develop. The first supermarkets
         recently appeared in Makeevka (Sarepta chain), Mariupol (Litva), Yenakievo (Lavanda).

4.2.6.   Zaporizhia


Zaporizhia can be considered as one of the most promising territories for investments into retail development in

the Eastern part of Ukraine. The city has a favorable location near Dnipropetrovsk and uses its well-developed

infrastructure. Zaporizhia is a large industrial center, and the retail sector suffers from lack of attention and

financing.



Key statistics52:
         Area of the city  334 km2

         Number of districts (rayons)  7

         Population  815 thousand inhabitants

         Average monthly income in Zaporizhia oblast, per capita, 2001  USD 37 (UAH 197)

         Total number of retail outlets in Zaporizhia oblast is 3,603 (including 2,526 stores)

         Total number of retail outlets in the city (according to the local retail authorities)  about 2,500.
         Average size of stores in Zaporizhia and towns of Zaporizhia oblast  116 m2

         Retail turnover (Zaporizhia oblast) in 2001  USD 325 mn



Supermarkets54

         There are more than 10 food supermarkets in the city

         % Supermarkets / Other Retail Outlets  3-5 %

         Retail gross margin in supermarkets is about 20% on average
         Space is available for purchase at appr. USD 200-300 per 1 m2, and for rent  USD 6-20 per 1 m2

         (depending on location)



Major players


As of the beginning of 2003 there were more than 10 supermarkets in Zaporizhia.


Kit-1 Trading Company is the leader in the regional niche, operating 6 Kit supermarkets. They are located both

in the centre and in residential areas.


Though sales areas of Kit supermarkets located in the city center are small, turnover per 1 m2 is high compared
to other outlets of the chain. Thus, in the stores in the central street, average monthly turnover per 1 m2

reaches USD 500-540, while on other sites  USD 250-300.

          Way of getting to supermarket  75% - on foot; 13% - by own car, 11% - by public transport



 Local characteristics

        Zaporizhia is one of the most attractive territories for retail development in Eastern Ukraine. It has a

        favorable location near Dnipropetrovsk (93 km) and uses its developed infrastructure.

        The city is spread unevenly over the banks of the Dnipro river. Left and right banks have different

        landscapes. Up to 70% of housing is located near industrial enterprises. City center is concentrated

        around Lenina Avenue and adjoining streets. This feature has to be considered when selecting the

        location for a retail outlet.

        As the city is an industrial center, the majority of the investments are directed into industry development,

        while retail sector feels lack of financing.

        High season in food retail: national and religious holidays, City Day, professional holidays (Metallurgist

        Day).

 4.2.7.   Lviv


 Being the only large city in the Western part of Ukraine, Lviv will offer good investment opportunities in retail
 sector due to its favorable location (close to Polish border), loyal consumers' attitude to modern retail formats
 and absence of large-scale retail outlets in the city.

 Key statistics56:

          Area of the city - 155 km2
          Number of districts (rayons)  6
          Population  733 thousand inhabitants

 Supermarkets58

          There are about 20 food supermarkets in the city
          Share of new retail formats in total retail turnover of the city is estimated at about 10% in 2002
          Retail gross margin in supermarkets ranges from 15 to 20%
          Space is available for rent at appr. USD 10-20 per 1 m2
          Warehouse space is leased at the price of USD 1-6 per m2 and is available for purchase at USD 50-100 per m2

 Major players

 The supermarket sector has just began to develop. The first modern supermarket VAM was opened in March 2002.

 The second one, Arsen, opened its doors in June 2002. However, the background of these outlets is different. Arsen

 belongs to Intermarket chain, which has operated in the Lviv market for 10 years, and has 13 stores. In contrast to

 Arsen, VAM is the first outlet of Pam'yat LLC that has just entered the retail market.

 There are also 3 supermarkets under Leader brand. They operate on franchising conditions and are managed by

 Ukrainska Torgivelna Systems LLC (the chain has 4 stores in Western regions and belongs to Polish owners). Lutsk-based

 Agrocontract operates a cash & carry store on the main street of Lviv (Gorodotska) next to Intermarket's cash & carry.

 Two companies operating in the supermarket segment (Intermarket and Pam'yat) have their representatives in the
 City Council and, therefore, face no problems with land plot allocation and chain development. Just recently these
 retailers obtained permits for land use for their supermarkets on the same street  Chornovola Avenue. It should be
 mentioned that Leader supermarket already operates on the same street.

 It is expected that Intermarket and Pam'yat will continue their expansion in retail in the coming years, and will
 contribute to the growth of the supermarket sector.

           Average daily number of purchases in one supermarket  5,000 - 5,500

           Way of getting to supermarket  51% - on foot; 26% - by own car, 23% - by public transport


 Local characteristics

 Lviv attracts relatively large investments (USD 119.7 mn as of 1 January 2002), about 7% of them have been
 directed to trade industry development.

 The city enjoys a favorable location in Western Ukraine close to the Polish border. Proximity to Poland has
 considerable influence on trade sector growth and development in the region, as well as on consumers'
 behavior that is rather advanced compared to other Ukrainian regions. However, some slowdown in cross-
 border trade can occur due to the introduction of a visa regime for Ukrainian citizens from 1 July 2003.

 Though the supermarket sector is in the early stage of its development, this market is being formed under the
 strong influence of the experienced market leader Intermarket Trading Company. At the moment Intermarket
 enjoys a monopoly position in the regional market and dictates rules in relations with suppliers as well as `sets
 up standards' for wholesale and retail in Lviv.

 There are no hypermarkets or large shopping centers in Lviv. One of the `early birds' in this category is VAM
 Supermarket that leased out the second floor of the building (about 3,000 m2 of sales area) to non-food outlets
 including electronics and baby supermarkets, clothes boutiques, etc.

 City authorities support development of modern retail format and have intentions to transform some street
 markets into shopping centers. However, this results in conflicts between city top authorities and management
 of open markets.

 Consumers demand from local retailers the same level of service and product range as you can find in Poland
 where retail has been rapidly developing in the past decade.

 High season in food retail: traditional national and religious holidays, local religious holidays, name days (like
 Andrew, Roman, Anna, Kateryna, etc.)

 Lviv retailers announce special offers on name days for those called by this name. For example, in VAM

 Supermarket on Andrew day (13 December) if you prove you are Andrew by showing your passport, you can

 receive a special card and present.

5.       Key Foreign and Domestic Players, New Entrants - Profiles of 25 Retailers


This chapter describes the major players in the Ukrainian retailing market. The core information was obtained

in the course of interviews with managers of retail chains and stores. It is supported by secondary publicly

available data about the companies.

5.1.1.     ATB Market


                 Having set up a large chain of discount-like shops (according to experts' estimate, about 80) in Eastern

                 Ukraine, ATB-Market can be considered one of the leading regional retailers. Its shops are located in

5.1.3.    Billa

                      Billa  Ukraine is the only 100% foreign company operating in the Ukrainian retailing market.
                      It has started business in Kyiv and the largest cities in Eastern Ukraine and operates 8
                      supermarkets.     Development in the Ukrainian market was not easy for Billa and its
                      management because of many local peculiarities. However, the company implemented its
                      strategy (green-field construction only) and set up a chain of supermarkets.

Further development of Billa in Ukraine is viable with a long-term EBRD loan (EUR 45 mn for supermarket chain
development in Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria; total project cost exceeds EUR 200 mn for the three countries).

                                 When the company started, it immediately became a local pioneer and leader in
                                 self-service retail in Kharkiv. However, over 9 years of operation through
                                 hypermarket and supermarket-like stores, the corporate strategy has changed,
                                 and now Brig is shifting towards a discounter format.

5.1.7     Furshet


                                               Garantiya Trade which owns Furshet chain started its retailing
                                               business with a few small mini-markets La Furshet in Kyiv.
                                               Later, the company's management recognized the prospects of
                                               large retail formats, and the first Furshet store was opened in
                                               December 1998 in Podil district of Kyiv. This was the first store
of such a scale and it quickly gained popularity with consumers; many of them are still its frequent and loyal
customers.

At the moment the Furshet chain includes 18 stores, with short-term expansion plan to 23. For the chain's
development the company plans to invest mainly in shopping centers with large sales areas for supermarkets
(3,000 - 4,000 m2) and other stores. Availability of convenient parking will be a mandatory pre-requisite.

Furshet has also won the competition for the supermarket area in two Kyiv shopping centers that are
scheduled to open in spring 2003. Thus, in Mandarin Plaza and Ukraina the company presents its new
format - delicatessen supermarkets under Furshet Gurman brand. The first Furshet Gurman in Mandarin
Plaza has just opened (late April 2003) with sales area of 2,000 m2.

                                       filling stations, manufacturing and trading companies, and hotels. The company

       has not been fast, but steady in the development of its retail business: its first store opened in January 2000 in

       the center of Kyiv, and the second one in December 2002 in the residential district of the Ukrainian capital.

       The first Tiko Market, a wholesale and retail store located in the Kyiv center, enjoys popularity with consumers: in

       2002 more than 1 mn customers visited the shop; most of those visitors are regular clients. Customer flow had

       been so abundant that the company's management decided to introduce a special 5% morning discount in order

       to avoid crowds and long lines.

5.2.      New entrants


Though many international and local companies have declared their interest in Ukrainian retail, only one

company has started market penetration using, as its management assumes, `first move advantage'.


5.2.1.    Metro Cash & Carry Ukraine Ltd


                                                Metro AG is entering the Ukrainian market with its wholesale

                                                subdivision  Metro Cash & Carry (as of the beginning 2002 -

                                                384 outlets in 22 countries). It has already set up a local branch

 Metro Cash & Carry Ukraine, and opening of its first outlet is scheduled for 24 August 2003 (construction

started in February 2003).


Internationalization strategy of Metro AG sets a rather ambitious target of going into one or two new countries
every year.60 In 2001 the expansion plans were successfully implemented in Russia and Croatia. In 2003 a

new chain will be established in Ukraine.


Tried and tested methods are being used to open up markets, which limit the risks normally incurred when

entering an unknown market:

          Metro AG adopts standardized merchandizing concepts across the various countries despite the
          different structural and cultural framework conditions and the often significantly differing customer
          wants and needs.

          Due to more than 40 years of expansion experience, the concepts used by Metro Group are highly
          adaptable to the market conditions of the host country. In parallel, the company has gained high
          worldwide acceptance in industry and society.

          Economic success of Metro in foreign markets is ensured by a professional approach to the
          preparation and implementation of market entry.

          Another basic pre-requisite for successfully expanding an outlet chain abroad is the recruitment of
          qualified local personnel.



To guarantee a successful and smooth new market entry, a special transnational form of organization has

been developed. It provides for all major administrative functions (like accounting or logistics coordination,

personnel training) to be performed as a service by the management of a neighboring country (so called

`support country'). The local head office is then free to concentrate on operational core functions like

purchasing fresh products or personnel management.


In 2001 this mode was successfully implemented in Russia, where business activities were supported by the

management team in Bulgaria (Metro entered the Bulgarian market in 1999). The same country has been

selected as a support country for start-up of Metro Cash & Carry Ukraine.


Metro plans development of cash & carry chain in Ukraine through establishment of outlets in the largest

cities: first, in Kyiv, and later in Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia. In order to carry out

these plans, the company has already enlisted support from the Ukrainian state and regional authorities.

professional services for professional customers. Access to the stores will be open to customer card holders

only.

Annex 1. Ukrainian political and business environment




Ukrainian regional division


Ukraine is divided into 24 oblasts, which are approximately equal in size, and the Autonomous Republic of the

Crimea (Crimea). The cities of Kyiv and Sevastopil have a special status for historic reasons (in contrast to

other cities, which are of oblast subordination, these two cities are of state subordination).


The largest city of the oblast is considered the oblast center, and usually the oblast is named after this city

(Lviv oblast, Donetsk oblast, etc.). Only Zakarpattia oblast with its center in Uzhorod and Volyn oblast with

center in Lutsk do not follow this principle. The capital of the Crimea is Simferopol.


Each oblast and the Crimea is divided into 11 to 26 rayons. The population of a rayon can range from 100,000

to 300,000 inhabitants.


Larger towns in each oblast have the same status as rayons, and are called `towns of oblast subordination'.


Large cities (oblast centers) are divided into 5 to 10 city districts, also called rayons, with population from

70,000 to 300,000.



Ukrainian authorities


Country level:


President of Ukraine

President is the head of the state, but not the head of the executive body (this is the Prime Minister). The

President of Ukraine is elected for a five-year term in a general election.         He is involved in activities of

legislative and executive bodies, such as approval and vetoing laws, appointment of the Prime Minister (subject

to approval by the Parliament) and dismissing him, regulating some issues of an executive body by presidential
decrees, and appointing a third of the judges to the Constitutional Court. The President has an extensive and

influential staff, the Presidential Administration.


Parliament of Ukraine

The Parliament of Ukraine is called Verkhovna Rada. This is the united government legislative body that
determines the main regulations concerning internal and foreign policy of Ukraine. Verkhovna Rada is the
only body, authorized to adopt laws - the legislative documents having the highest force (except for the
Constitution of Ukraine, being the superior legislative act). Verkhovna Rada confirms the appointment of a
number of top government officials, including the Prime Minister and the Prosecutor General.


Government of Ukraine

The Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers together form the Government of Ukraine. The Cabinet of

Ministers is the state executive body headed by the Prime Minister and Vice Prime Ministers. The Cabinet of
Ministers is responsible for implementing laws passed by Verkhovna Rada and signed by the President. The
field ministries of Ukraine report to the Cabinet of Ministers.



                                                   85

Crimea is an autonomous republic of Ukraine. Territory-wise, it is similar to oblasts. It has its own
Parliament and Cabinet of Ministers, which issue normative acts spreading their authority over Crimea.
However, the acts have to be in line with laws and decrees of Ukraine.


Local (city) level:


State Administrations

State administrations are established in Ukraine at the levels as follows: oblast level, city level (only in Kiev and

Sevastopol cities) and district level.


State administration is a local government executive authority. This body is subordinated to the Cabinet of

Ministers. During fulfillment of its tasks the state administration reports to the President of Ukraine as well as to

the Cabinet of Ministers. The head of state administration informs the President and the Cabinet of Ministers

about social, political and economic situations in relevant territories.


City Council

City Council is a representative institution of local government. This authority decides on the issues of local

importance. City Council is elected by the city population for a four-year term. Functions of the City Council

are listed below:
        management of municipal property,
        approval and control over implementation of social, economic and cultural development programs,
        approval of budget and control over its administration,
        establishment of local taxes and duties,
        conducting local referendums and the implementation of their outcomes,
        management of communal (municipal) enterprises,
        other tasks placed under the jurisdiction of local governments.


City Executive Committee

City Executive Committee is an executive authority of the City Council and is established for fulfillment of

executive functions and responsibilities of local self-government.


Ukrainian business entities


There are two main types of business entities in Ukraine:

         Physical persons - individual entrepreneurs that can perform business activity without registering as

         a legal entity;

         Legal entities, the most common for carrying out business are the following:

                      Private enterprise  the enterprise established on the private property of a Ukrainian

                       citizen.

                            into shares, proportionally to founders' contributions, which are indicated in
                            the statute documents. The founders' liability is limited by the amount of their
                            shares.

                         CJSC (closed joint-stock company)  type of joint-stock company, which can

                          distribute its shares only between the founders and not by means of public

                          subscription or purchase / sale on stock exchanges.


Ukrainian taxation system

The system of taxation in Ukraine is specified in the Law of Ukraine On System of Taxation. The most

common Ukrainian taxes are:



       Enterprise profit tax - currently 30%; as of 1 January 2004, the system of charging this tax will be

       different, the rate will be 25%.

       Social security and other mandatory deductions to non-budgetary social funds (38% of salaries,

       split between the social security fund (2.9%), the employment fund (2.1%), the pension fund (32%)

       and accident insurance fund (1%).

       Unified tax - is the option for taxation of:

       1) Small-scale enterprises, employing less than 50 persons during 1 calendar year and having

            annual revenue of less than UAH 1,000,000

       2) Individual entrepreneurs, carrying out business without registering as a legal entity, employing less

            than 10 persons during 1 calendar year and having annual revenue of less than UAH 500,000

     For individual entrepreneurs, the rates of the unified tax are set by the local city councils at their

     registration locations.



     For the enterprises (legal entities), which take decision to be taxed by unified tax, one of the following

     rates is applicable (in their option):

     - 6% of the amount of proceeds from the sales, excluding excise duty, in case paying VAT (see the

       definition below);

     - 10% of the amount of proceeds from the sales, excluding excise duty, in the case VAT is included in

       the unified tax.


     The regulation of the unified tax is specified in the Presidential Decree No. 727/98 of 3 July 1998 On

     Simplified Taxation, Accounting and Reports of Small-Scale Entrepreneurs.


       Personal income tax - is on a progressive scale. The tax is not charged for the monthly gross income

       of 1 or less non-taxable minimum income (equaling UAH 17, or approx. USD 3.2). The minimal rate of

       10% is charged for the income amounts from 1 non-taxable minimum income + UAH 1, up to 5 non-

       taxable minimum incomes. The maximum rate of 40% is charged for the income amounts exceeding

       100 non-taxable minimum incomes. There are certain types of income, which are exempted from

       income tax.

       Value added tax (VAT) - generally its rate is 20% which is to be included in the price of products,

       goods and services. In certain cases the rate is 0% - e.g. when the goods or services are sold to be

       consumed outside Ukraine. Certain transactions are exempt from VAT and certain are not subject to

       VAT (e.g. children's food, pension services and some other categories).

       Excise tax - up to 300% to be included in the price (for certain categories of goods and services).

       Miscellaneous taxes (e.g., import-export duties).

Annex 2. Sources of information



Most of the information was obtained from interviews with key Ukrainian retailers, as well as with experts on the

retail (including, but not limited to, local trade authorities, merchandise and equipment suppliers, retail

promoters, financial organizations, consumers, etc.)


In the course of the survey preparation, alternative sources of statistical information were also used, such as:
        State Statistics Committee of Ukraine,
        Ministry of Economy and European Integration of Ukraine,
        Ministry of Finance of Ukraine,
        National Bank of Ukraine,
        Independent research institutions (International Center for Policy Studies, Institute for Economic

         Research and Policy Consulting),
        Publications of news agencies and press referring to official sources.


When analyzing barriers for business development and operating in the retail sector, official publications of

Ukrainian laws and regulations were used. All legislative documents are available to the public at the Internet

site of Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) - http://www.rada.gov.ua/laws/pravo/new/index.html. Also useful

in this respect is the information offered by the State Tax Administration of Ukraine at its site 

http://www.sta.gov.ua/.

Studies (ICPS) regarding GDP growth is most pessimistic (3.5%). According to the Institute for Economic

Research and Policy Consulting (IERPC), real GDP will grow by approximately 4.6% in 2003 mainly due to

growth in private consumption. Forecast of NBU is close to this figure  4.5 - 4.8%. The Cabinet of Ministers

forecasts GDP increments of 5-6% by the end of 2003 and nearly 8% in 2004.


Ukrainian industrial output increased by 7% in 2002 vs. 2001 and amounted to USD 32.1 bn (UAH 171.2 bn).

Manufacturing industry output increased by 8.9% including growth of 8.4% in the food-processing industry.


Agricultural output will grow at a slower pace when compared to the higher harvest in 2001-2002. Nevertheless,

the forecast says that agricultural output will grow in 2003 and 2004 in case modern growing technologies are

used.


Exchange rate of Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) to US Dollar (USD) is quite stable. The National Bank of Ukraine

keeps floating the nominal exchange rate based on real effective rate that takes into account the inflation rate,

the exchange rate of the main foreign trade partners and world currency tendencies. The National Bank of

Ukraine forecasts the average exchange rate for 2003 at the level of UAH/USD 5.48.


Financial situation of Ukraine is characterized by relative stability conditioned by moderate inflation, a relatively

stable exchange rate of national currency vs. world major currencies (US Dollar and EURO), the growth of

international reserves, and the administration of state budget either with proficit or with small deficit.

               securities reached almost UAH 15 bn, which is 139% higher than in 2001. At that, according to data of

               the National Bank of Ukraine, as of the end of 2002 the amount of accumulated household deposits in

               the Ukrainian banks totaled UAH 19 bn, which is 171% higher than in 2001.

Annex 7. Retail sector characteristics in countries of Central and Eastern Europe



This Annex presents main trends in retail sector development in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe

(CEE) by country.


Recent development in Poland and Russia are given in more details than in other countries as

     -   Ukraine borders on both countries and follows their pattern in its development;

     -   retail markets in these countries are developed to a higher extent than the Ukrainian market.



Poland



       Poland is one of the leaders in attraction of foreign direct investment in CEE and, according to statistics

       of the Polish Agency for Foreign Investment (PAIZ), more than USD 50 bn has been invested in the

       country over the last 10 years (about USD 1,300 per capita).

       Polish retail market is relatively large. In the 90's, the market was developing at the rate of 2-7% (in

       real terms), with the exception of the first two years of the decade. In 2001 retail turnover amounted to

       about USD 90 bn.

       Total number of retail outlets in Poland is around 380,000. This number includes 117,200 food stores

       (structure of food retail outlets is shown on figure below), 20,850 household goods and cosmetics

       stores, 81,400 alternative channels (HoReCa, press kiosks, convenience outlets, petrol stations, etc)

       and 160,000 other consumer-product outlet types.

       Modern format market has developed significantly over the last 5 years. By the end of 2001 the

       number of hypermarkets increased by 21%, supermarkets  by 12-13%, discounters  by 5%.

Average shop sales area per 1,000 inhabitants was 797.2 m2 in 2001 (98 shops/10,000 inhabitants).

Share of modern distribution channels (supermarkets, hypermarkets and discount stores) in Poland was
29% in 2001. Number of shops with sales area of more than 400 m2 increased by 55.8% compared to

1997.

Shopping center sector has grown rapidly. There are more than 120, mainly hypermarket-anchored,
shopping centers in Poland, which offer 2,846,000 m2 of total sales area. In early 2002 the provision of
shopping center sales area was 62 m2 per 1,000 inhabitants, notably lower than the European average
(143.2 m2). Poland sits between the Czech Republic (54.1 m2) and Hungary (63.3 m2) in terms of per

capita provision.

Polish retailing market is occupied by approximately 20 foreign retail chains (among them - 10 largest

trade companies in Poland). As of the end of 2001, the leading retail chains in the Polish market were

Real (Metro, Germany), Biedronka (Jeronimo Martins, Portugal), Geant (Geant, France), Auchan

(Auchan, France).

Foreign chains own almost all hypermarkets opened in Poland during 1997-2002. In 2002, they ran about

400 large outlets employing around 80,000 Polish workers. However, in total, foreign trade chains control

about 15% of Polish retailing market. At the same time it is expected that their share will reach 40% by

2004.

In parallel to retail development, state regulation of the sector has been toughened.


Thus, in July 2002 Polish Parliament (Sejm) passed a resolution on urging state administration agencies

to run checks on supermarkets and hypermarkets. The checks referred to in the resolution were to

embrace the upholding of labor legislation, tax laws, hygiene and sanitation standards, the principles of

protection of competition and consumers and the use of dumping prices by large retailers.


In November 2002 Sejm passed a law on retail trade, which was designed to defend small retailers from

encroachment by large chains. The law limits and declares the assortment of goods offered by retail
chains and sales conditions. Therefore, stores with sales area exceeding 400 m2 are not allowed:


    to sell goods or services at a price that does not include a markup (exclusion is made only for special

     reasons)
    to sell goods for which customers can pay in coupons issued by large chains


Moreover, there is a special limitation for discounter chains: share of private labels cannot exceed 20% of

total sales in the chain.



In 2003 there will be the continuation of the long-term consolidation process in the Polish retailing

market. The process was started in the middle of 2002 with the takeover of the German chain Hit by the

British Tesco. Over the next few years it is expected that a group of three to five companies will emerge,

which will ultimately control around 50% of the foodstuff market, following the pattern in other European

countries.

According to GfK Polonia, this market concentration process will take about 10-15 years in total. After

that, around 75% of the retail shopping bills will be run up in stores belonging to large chains.

Russia


      Investments into Russian retail sector totaled USD 5 bn (cumulative as of end of 2002), or 12% of total

      FDI. At the same time investments in retail in 2002 reached almost USD 2 bn. As foreign investments are

      mainly `working' in Moscow and St. Petersburg, retail is developing mostly in these two cities.

      In 2001 Russian retail turnover exceeded USD 102 bn. Retail trade turnover was steadily growing in

      2002 and totaled USD 118.6 bn. Increment over the last two years was at the level of about 10% (in real

      terms).

      Food sales amount to 46.1% of total retail turnover in 2002. Increased share of non-food sales evidences

      recent development in this sector as well.

      According to ACNielsen data, turnover of mini-, super- and hypermarkets makes about 6.5% of total retail

      turnover of Russia. In Moscow this share is much higher  18%. Change in shares of retail trade formats

      in total retail turnover in Russia is demonstrated by the diagrams below.

      More than 450,000 retail outlets presently operate in Russia. The number of supermarkets doubled over

      2000-2002. The number of mini-markets increased by 30%. At the same time, the number of grocery

      stores and kiosks was reduced by 10% and 26% respectively.

      According to Moscow Consumer Market Department, city retail turnover exceeded USD 34 bn in 2002

      (almost 30% of total Russian retail sales). As of the end of 2002, there were 24 food retail chains with

      345 stores in Moscow.

      Key Moscow and international retailers are expanding in Saint Petersburg market. As of 2002, the city

      annual food retail turnover was estimated by market operators at USD 3-6 bn. Largest St. Petersburg

      chains at the moment include Piatiorochka, Lenta, Megamart, Kopeyka and Diksi. According to data of

      Economic Development, Industrial Policy and Trade Committee, 3,976 food stores (with total sales area
      of 428,600 m2) and 179 stores with mixed assortment (40,200 m2) operate in the city.

      Trend for shopping center development is clearly seen in the largest Russian cities. In 2002 there were
      19 shopping centers in Moscow, which offered 1 mn m2 of total sales area. In 2003 the number of
      shopping centers is supposed to increase up to 33 and their total sales area will reach 1.5 mn m2. In the

      opinion of foreign investors, this supply of modern sales area is the maximum required for existing

      retailers' demand.

      According to Business Analitika, at the beginning of 2002 there were 95 m2 of shopping center sales area
      per 1,000 people in Moscow, and 54 m2  in St. Petersburg.

      The largest Russian food retailers: Perekrestok, Kopeyka, Diksi, Megamart founded the Russian Retail

      Alliance in April 2001. The joint annual turnover of the alliance is USD 500 mn. The companies hope that

      the Alliance will help them confront the `dictate' of manufacturers.

      The strongest company in the retail Alliance is Perekrestok, which is a retail chain and wholesaler. The

      company has 38 shops: 1 hypermarket, 37 supermarkets and 8 discounters. The second place is taken

      by Diksi  30 shops. Kopeyka and Piatiorochka have 26 discounters each.

      A few foreign retailers already operate in Russia, although several companies have investigated the

      market, and now they are looking for reliable partners and are negotiating with the Moscow government

      opening of new stores. Highlights of major recent development of foreign retailers in Russia are as

      follows:

        Metro Cash & Carry opened two stores in Moscow in 2002 (intentions for Moscow and oblast  to open

         9 stores by 2006), and plans to expand to St. Petersburg, as well as to major cities along Volga and

         Don rivers with more than 1 mn inhabitants, that makes them particularly attractive for other retailers.

        French company Auchan is about to start construction of its third store in the Russian capital. The first

         two hypermarkets were opened in Moscow in 2002.

Hungary



      Retail trade turnover of Hungary amounted to USD 23,626 mn in 2002, thus having an increase of 10.7%

      compared to 2001.

      The Hungarian retail trade is characterized by high density of the retail network  161 shops per 10,000

      inhabitants.

      New retail formats in Hungary make up nearly 50% of the market. At the same time, development of hard

      discounters is most dynamic. Their growth rate in Hungary is 22%.

      In 2002, the share of international retailers in the Hungarian retailing market was 65%. According to

      ACNielsen estimations, 7 of 15 of the largest retail companies in the world are already active in Hungary.

      The market leader in Hungary is German Metro AG. Its share of the market was 16.3% in 2001.

      Among local companies CBA, Co-op Hungary, Honiker and Provera should be mentioned. Their market

      shares were 12.8, 11.3, 9.4 and 9.1% respectively (as of end of 2001). It should be stressed that CBA

      and Co-op Hungary started expansion to other CEE countries and are in the list of the ten largest

      retailers in Central and Eastern Europe.




Czech Republic



      Czech retail sector is in the process of consolidation and new large shop formats dominate in the local

      retailing market. The share of hypermarkets, supermarkets, and discounters reached 70% in 2002.

      Further growth of interest in large regional shopping centers across the country is expected.

      The number of hypermarkets surged from 2 to 105 over 1996 - 2001, driving many small retailers out of

      business. Hypermarkets in Czech Republic increased their share in total retail turnover from 2-3% in

      1997 to 21% in 2002.

      Czech supermarkets have the largest share of the retail turnover  32%. The share of discounters in

      retail turnover is 17%.

      Over the recent years Czech Republic has been of a keen interest for developers of large stores, mainly

      large European retail chains (Ahold, Rewe, Tangelmann). In 2002 the ratio of foreign to local retail chains

      was 10:1.




Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia)



        According to Profindex data, in 2001 retail trade turnover in Estonia amounted to USD 781 mn, in

        Latvia  USD 1,300 mn and the largest  in Lithuania  USD 1,900 mn.

        In the Baltic States supermarkets are driving their smaller rivals out of the retailing market. It seems

        that Baltic States are following the Scandinavian pattern of retailing market development and the share

        of supermarkets will reach up to 70-80% of food retailing market.

        Turnover of retail chains and open markets is in the following ratio:

         Though Estonia is relatively small by number of inhabitants (about 1.4 mn), this market turned out to be

         of high interest for many European retailers. Large chains (mainly foreign) considerably changed the

         situation in retail, starting from the Estonian capital Tallinn. According to the results of 2002, the largest

         supermarket chains controlled about half of the Estonian market, and almost two thirds  in the capital.

         Kesko Food Eesti AS, Finnish retailer, takes one of the leading positions in the Estonian market (with

         its Citymarket chain and Sstumarket and SuperNetto discounter chains). In 2002 Kesko Food's

         share in Estonian food retail was about 20% with turnover of USD 150 mn. Having currently 15% in

         total retail turnover, the second largest Estonian chain owned by AS Selver plans to further increase its

         share. German Lidl also intends to expand to the Estonian market.

         In Lithuania the two leading retail operators are local companies  Vilniaus Prekyba (or VP Markets)

         and Pas Juozapa. Being Lithuania's largest rapidly developing retail chain, Vilniaus Prekyba, is also

         the largest retail chain in the Baltics (about 400 outlets). Retail turnover of VP Markets exceeds 20% of

         the total retail turnover of Lithuania.

         Rimi retail chain of Varner Baltia JV (Norwegian-Latvian capital) has a leading position in the Latvian

         market. In 1999 this company acquired one of the largest Latvian retail chains, Interpegro, and gained

         a dominant market share.

  an annual basis only and results are announced in the spring of the next year. Unfortunately, results of 2002 are still not

  available.
