By Boston Herald editorial staff | June 1, 2019 at 12:34 amU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling is the real deal. He has proved himself to be a consistent, aggressive advocate for the people he serves and not an erratic adherent to the progressive fads of the day. Bucking social trends can lead to criticism and it creates enemies, but when all is said and done, there is right and there is wrong and Lelling has been doing what is right.
Leading the charge on the college admission scandal, the U.S. attorney made it clear that the letter of the law worked side by side with the concept of equality of opportunity. There will not be a separate admissions system for the wealthy. And there will not be a separate criminal justice system either, Lelling said.
For every student admitted through fraud, an honest and genuinely talented student was rejected, he continued, adding that it was the largest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice.
In April, Lelling once again stood up for the good guys with an indictment of Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph, 51, of Natick. Joseph was indicted on federal charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting for allegedly interfering with a federal investigation.
She was accused of helping a Dominican national in the country illegally slip out the back door of a Newton courthouse last year to escape from an ICE agent waiting in the lobby.
This case is about the rule of law, Lelling said. The allegations in todays indictment involve obstruction by a sitting judge, that is intentional interference with the enforcement of federal law, and that is a crime. We cannot pick and choose the federal laws we follow, or use our personal views to justify violating the law. Everyone in the justice system  not just judges, but law enforcement officers, prosecutors and defense counsel  should be held to a higher standard. The people of Massachusetts expect that, just like they expect judges to be fair, impartial and to follow the law themselves.
If the law is not applied equally, Lelling continued, it cannot credibly be applied to anyone. Are judges special? Sure. But not because of the privileges they have enjoyed. Theyre special because theyre entrusted with enormous power.
Amen.
This week, Lelling joined the Heralds Adriana Cohen on Herald Radio in-studio for almost an hour. Among other subjects, he spoke about the effects of illegal immigration in the Bay State.


We do see a correlation as far as we see towns in the commonwealth, where a significant percentage of the bulk drug dealers who we are arresting are also here illegally, Lelling said.
When Cohen asked about a 14-year-old Maryland girl who was hacked to death, allegedly by MS-13 gang members, Lelling said, Had ICE been able to detain and deport those MS-13 members, those MS-13 members would not have been here, and they would not have been able to kill this woman. So yes, there is a direct impact on the public safety.
This U.S. attorney has declared war on MS-13 and the results are plain as day. When talking to reporters in 2018 he declared, MS-13 is probably one of the biggest success stories of the last year. MS-13 has all but been eradicated in the Greater Boston area. Were running out of MS-13 targets.
That is effective law enforcement and we are fortunate that Andrew Lelling is our man in the big chair.
