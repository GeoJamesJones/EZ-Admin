Hospitals in Ukraine are under immense strain that will likely continue for a long time regardless
of how quickly the war can be ended. Doctors have been doing
a consistently heroic job, but are in dire need of more trauma-related equipment and surgical tools.  'Support Hospitals in Ukraine' is committed to support Ukrainian hospitals with much
needed modern medical equipment and supplies shipped from the United States of America. How we workThanks to tremendous support of our partners and the project model,$1 of your donations enables us to ship  to Ukraine   $25-27 of medical equipment and supplies.Process preparing for a new shipment 1  Project CURE, our supply partner, collects surplus medical supplies
and equipment from hospitals in different areas
of the USA, and stocks them in their warehouses. 2  Our volunteer, certified by Project CURE, goes
to Ukraine and performs in-person assessment
of Ukrainian recipient hospitals needs. The volunteer
works with the head doctors and business managers
of recipient hospitals to ensure that the hospitals have trained MDs and existing infrastructure to work with the medical equipment provided by our non-profit. 3  Support Hospitals in Ukraine raises $25,000 per
container to fund only two types of expenses: (i)
Project CURE operating costs and (ii) shipment
to Ukraine. 4  Upon receipt of the funds, Project CURE packs a 40-ft
container by matching receiving hospitals request
(compiled by a certified volunteer in conjunction
with senior receiving hospital staff) and inventory
on hand. 5  Once the supplies are selected, the final packing list is sent to the customs broker of our
registered partner non-profit
in Ukraine, who uses it to get humanitarian aid
duty-free designation for the contents of the
container from the Ukrainian government. 6  The container is shipped by sea, clears customs duty-free
in Ukraine, and is released to the recipient hospitals.
Hospitals officials sign receipt paperwork.
A volunteer from Support Hospitals in Ukraine goes
to each recipient hospital to ensure proper equipment transfer and ongoing follow-up.   NewsJune 7, 2019MoU with the Embassy of Ukraine in the USAH.E.
