So we use it for them.After the breakup of the Soviet Union, farmland in newly independent Ukraine was divided among villagers, acre by acre, creating a patchwork of agricultural endeavors that are often inefficient or unprofitable. Some land is rented to fruit growers, grain operators or large-scale farming businesses. Some locals work small plots on their own. Some acreage sits fallow, stuck in legal limbo after the owner has died.Ukraine was once the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, known for its rich soil where grain, sunflowers and livestock flourished. But farming production dropped sharply in the chaotic decade after the collapse of communism, and recovery has come in fits and starts. Production is only now returning to peak levels of the 1990s, stymied by the corruption, red tape and inefficiencies that have plagued the broader Ukrainian economy for years and left the villagers living humble existences.Restoring Ukraines farming legacy will be crucial to the success of the countrys newly elected president, the billionaire businessman Petro O. Poroshenko. Such efforts would go a long way toward fixing Ukraines economy and reducing its dependence on Russia. Agriculture once accounted for nearly 20 percent of the gross domestic product; it is now roughly 10 percent.The potential became clear last year when a strong harvest helped Ukraine avoid a drop in output. It was just because of agriculture, said Pavlo Sheremeta, Ukraines minister of economic development. Otherwise, it would have been a decline.Against the backdrop of the crisis with Russia, Western interests are pressing for change. The European Union is moving forward with a plan to bolster trade by lifting custom duties on Ukrainian agriculture. As part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for up to $18 billion in loans, the countrys government must push through business reforms that would help alleviate the problems with farming and other businesses.The hope is that such initiatives will also bolster the confidence of foreign investors as the crisis abates. Big multinationals have expressed tentative interest in Ukrainian agriculture, but they have largely remained on the sidelines, unwilling to invest in an industry hampered by structural deficiencies and, more recently, the uncertainty with its eastern neighbor.If cheap capital comes in along with foreign investment, and you have a good government without roadblocks, Ukraine can close to double its production in the future, said Roman Fedorowycz, a Ukrainian-American who returned here years ago and now runs a farming company that grows mainly corn, sunflowers and soybeans.Even small improvements would make a big difference in a highly inefficient industry starved for money. While roughly 70 percent of Ukraines land is considered suitable for agriculture, it has not been fully cultivated. The countrys yield per hectare of grain is about half that of the United States, according to the World Bank.ImageA map shows how one villages farmland is split among 507 owners. Ownership of much of Ukraines land is in limbo.CreditYurko Dyachyshyn for The New York TimesChange wont come easy, given the challenges. Previous governments have tried to restrict what crops farmers grow and when they rotate crops, as well as limiting exports. Some state inspectors lack cars to conduct on-site inspections, so farmers must bring grain to them before shipping.Selling farmland is also forbidden in Ukraine, a legacy of its communist past. So fields remain cut up like chessboards, said Georgiy Vaydanych, land manager for Agrokultura, a Stockholm-based agricultural company that rents 173,000 acres in many such villages. For the moment we have 40,000 active landlords, Mr. Vaydanych said. Forty thousand!Making matters worse, paperwork is costly and many villagers never officially inherit the farmland after their parents die. There is uncertainty on how to farm this land, because we have the dead souls in the middle of our fields, Mr. Vaydanych said, in a reference to Nikolai Gogol, whose 19th-century classic, Dead Souls, is required school reading here.Even as the crisis in the east intensifies, life in the agricultural west remains much the same.A dirt road straddling tilled fields leads into this village, with potholes so deep that drivers zigzag past each other. There are horse-drawn carts, roosters crowing, elderly women in kerchiefs and a church painted pale green topped by bulbous spires.Few in this pro-European area of Ukraine are nostalgic for Moscow. Still, Oleg Gusak, head of the village council, said life had not improved.When it was a collective, the level of life was better, he said, explaining that it was once a larger operation that harvested crops, had livestock and made clothing, furniture and jams.People even came from other regions, because we had so much work, he said, adding, Now, its not the same.Trouble raising capital at reasonable prices makes it difficult to start or expand farms.I have to pay up to 12 percent if I borrow in euros, said Taras Barshchovsky, an entrepreneur who founded T.B. Fruit, which makes fruit juices and whose rented orchards cover thousands of acres. He has expanded into Poland, where he said he could borrow for less than 3 percent.Those who work with Ukrainian banks in hryvnias, the national currency, they pay up to 20 percent or more. I dont believe you can profit and return money on that percentage, he added.And while other former Soviet bloc neighbors like Hungary, Romania and Poland began easing their land sale restrictions after joining the European Union, Ukraine has repeatedly delayed lifting its moratorium, considering the move politically risky in its agrarian society. In 2013, the government of Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed Ukrainian leader, extended the moratorium until 2016, after he expected to stand for re-election.ImageIn villages like Zibolky, Ukraine, farming production has been stymied for years by corruption, red tape and inefficiency.CreditYurko Dyachyshyn for The New York TimesIm afraid if I sell my land in the future my children will say their old grandfather drank away all their money, Hrynchyshyn Myroslaw, 62, said as he cleared a willow field near another village.With a laugh, he added: It depends how much you will pay me. If there are enough zeros, you can pay me.Volodymyr Baran, 43, a tractor mechanic, said he would never sell his six acres: The land is our bread.Such dynamics deter foreign investment, which has been tepid for years. Despite some interest from China and multinationals, large agricultural enterprises tend to be Ukrainian owned, and recent prominent deals have been less than they seemed. For example, Cargill paid a reported $200 million for a stake in UkrLandFarming, an agricultural holding company. But a Cargill spokeswoman emphasized that the shares were collateral for a loan rather than a long-term investment.The rules make it so much more difficult to understand, and to bring in investment, said David Sedik, a senior official at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Its not that a foreigner or a company has to buy the land, but it breeds opaqueness in the sector. You need transparent land laws.At his office, Mr. Vaydanych pulled out a village map and showed how its 2,500 acres were divvied up among 507 villagers.Every field is split, by little, little plots, he explained.Being a land manager requires a political touch. Mr. Vaydanych goes from village to village handing out favors, fending off competitors trying to outbid his rental contracts.A village chief, he said, may call us and tell us, its the wintertime, we have a lot of snowfall, so give us a forklift to clean the road. O.K., well, we do that.He may say this electricity substation is broken so we need urgently to repair it, or hes calling because the water pump at school broke, so we replace it, he said. Thats the commitment that comes with the land.I wouldnt be surprised by any request, Mr. Vaydanych said. It is about keeping everyone happy. Thats my work.Sofiia Kochmar contributed reporting.
