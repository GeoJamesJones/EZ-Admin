Our Network was established to manage Danone Southern Africas primary warehouse at its factory in Boksburg, which supplies regional distribution centres and cross dock delivery facilities. We expanded our operations to target clients in other sectors to ensure our contract logistics skills are not only exposed to the fresh market, but are accessible to the logistics and supply chain market.
        




We currently manage five warehouses with a total space of  37,638 sqm in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Atlas (Gauteng), Boksburg and Durban.

5 stockholding and 10 cross docks across South Africa.


We perform 85% of our customers deliveries in 24 hours.


We export to our customer agents in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland and Mozambique.


We have elected hauliers in line with our global standards.


We implement daily stock replenishment  between our stockholding facilities, and daily shuttles between these facilities and the cross docks.

Sectors

The business sectors we service include: 






Retail 


    Supermarkets and hypermarkets, DIY, household equipment as well as sporting goods, which require specific knowledge of peaks in activity to be managed efficiently, coupled with logistics flows in terms of storage or just-in-time deliveries. Our global clients in this sector include Carrefour, Auchan, Alina, Conforama, Castorama and GO Sport.






FMCG


   This sector requires the ability to manage flows from factory to client, with very high-quality standards in terms of respecting environmental standards. Associated with co-packing or postponement, the logistics services provided frequently lead to overall management of the supply chain. Our global team has delivered services to clients such as Pepsico, Panzani, Beiersdorf, Danone, P&G and PPG, offering different products but always with a focus on logistical flows and excellence.






Cosmetic & Fragrance


   This sector is characterised by automated order picking expertise in luxury or high-value added products. Highly flexible resources are needed in order to adapt to the seasonal nature of these products while also maintaining lasting high quality standards. Prestigious clients include Guerlain, Elizabeth Arden, Coty, Marionnaud, Loreal and Puig.






Fashion


  This sector is characterised by management of import and export flows worldwide, customs management, secure warehouses, precision in the management of products for a very large number of products stored, flat or hanging. It is vital to be able to adapt resources to seasonal volumes and sale periods. Chlo, Cortefield, Le Coq Sportif, Puma, Kiabi and CWF have placed their trust in ID Logistics.






High-Tech


    The speed of introducing new products to the market is a key requirement of the sector. Managing import flows from outside Europe, co-packing a very large number of units in record time and shipping them at the same time to different distribution channels are challenges faced every minute. Bouygues Telecom, Sony Electronique, Fuji, Avenir Telecom have entrusted their logistics to ID Logistics.






E-Commerce

Anticipating the unpredictability of orders by guaranteeing a no-fault no-delay end customer promise are the everyday challenges facing pure-play operators and multi-channel specialists. Vente-Prive, Cdiscount, Auchan.fr, Nespresso and Leroy Merlin sell a wide range of products but have the same requirements in terms of speed and excellence of execution.
