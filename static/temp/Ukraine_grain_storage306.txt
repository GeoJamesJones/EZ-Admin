MY2018/19 wheat and barley production volumes are forecast to remain relatively stable, with corn increasing slightly and rye decreasing. Due to unique weather conditions as well as changes to support policy, summer crop areas might face some uncertainty. Ukraine will remain an active grain exporter with Black Sea ports remaining the export gateway for grains. Wheat flour exports are growing for the fourth year in a row.
