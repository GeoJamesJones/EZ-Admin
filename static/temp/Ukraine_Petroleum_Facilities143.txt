As part of the tour, future oil workers and drillers had a chance to learn more about the processes of drilling and well workover, as well as the environment, health and safety (HSE) standards. The students also visited the liquefied petroleum gas production plant and received a unique opportunity to test the knowledge obtained in class.A total of 27 second-year students specializing in well drilling and 3 college instructors participated in the tour. Additional opportunities for other groups from the same college have already been scheduled; negotiations are also underway with other universities throughout Ukraine.The programs main goal is to cultivate young peoples interest in the profession and introduce them to the practical side of our work. Todays students will very soon become the backbone of Ukraines oil and gas industry. Our social duty as a company working in this sphere is to do everything we can to support their professional development, commented Viktor Gladun, General Director of PPC.In addition to educational programs, PPC offers internships for senior students and recent graduates, the best of which can receive employment offers at the company. For example, Lyubomir Ivashchenko, graduate of the Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas progressed from young trainee to technical engineer in a matter of six months.We are not afraid of recruiting early-career professionals and sharing with them the knowledge and experience that makes PPC a leader among private gas companies in Ukraine. At a time when the market is facing a shortage of skilled workers, we are happy to invest in development of young specialists, as we understand that their ambition, engagement and willingness to learn are the foundation for future development of the industry, said Lilia Tkachenko, Director of the Human Resources Department at PPC.About the CompanyAbout the CompanyHistoryMissionStrategyManagementCareerPartnershipContactsReports ProductionIn FiguresMap and LicencesGeologic dataTechnology, Industry ValuesEnvironmentPeopleCity Commercial ActivityHydrocarbonsDocument TemplatesProcurement Press CentreNewsEventsMedia libraryontacts for media queries  2005-2017 All rights reserved.
