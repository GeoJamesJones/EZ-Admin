 Location of Ukraine
Ukraine is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe,[1] Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of 603,628km2 (233,062sqmi),[2] making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world, and a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.
Ukraine has long been a global breadbasket because of its extensive, fertile farmlands, and it remains one of the world's largest grain exporters.[3][4] The diversified economy of Ukraine includes a large heavy industry sector, particularly in aerospace and industrial equipment.
