        DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      The Cargo 
      Handling, Storage and Warehousing in South Africa 2018 report 
      has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
    

      This report focuses on the loading and unloading of cargo, irrespective 
      of the transport mode used, and the operation of storage and warehousing 
      facilities for all kinds of goods, but excludes storage facilities 
      operated by companies for their own use.
    

      It examines current conditions and discusses the issues, difficulties 
      and opportunities facing the sector. Also covered are regulatory 
      developments and initiatives by government and local companies.

        The report profiles 51 companies including local subsidiaries of 
        multinationals such as Santova Logistics, local companies operating 
        internationally such as Barloworld and Grindrod and several 
        state-owned enterprises which dominate the sector such as Transnet and 
        SAA.
      


      Approximately 90% of South Africa's international trade is moved by sea 
      through Transnet ports in the form of containers, dry bulk, liquid bulk, 
      break-bulk and automotives. Air freight accounts for a very small 
      percentage of the total freight moved in, to and from South Africa.
    

      South African exports for the seven months to end-July 2018 increased by 
      3.6% while imports for the same period increased by 10.2%. Low economic 
      growth, the volatile currency, poor investor confidence and credit 
      rating downgrades will have a negative effect on the volume and value of 
      goods requiring handling, storage and warehousing..
    

      Transnet and South African Airways (SAA) are among the state-owned 
      entities under the spotlight in the commission of inquiry into state 
      capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, while SAA remains 
      financially vulnerable.
    

      A World Bank report reflects a significant drop in the performance of 
      South Africa's logistics industry based on factors including customs 
      efficiency, quality of infrastructure and logistics services, ability to 
      trace and track consignments and the frequency with which shipments 
      arrive on time.


      South African ports are losing their competitive edge to other African 
      ports due to their high port tariffs, congestion, berthing delays, 
      labour unrest, equipment availability and work stoppages.
