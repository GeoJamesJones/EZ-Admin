	                        Do I need an account to ship?

No. You can make a one-time shipment and pay via credit card with FedEx Ship Manager Lite.However, if you sign in or set up a FedEx account, youll get discounts, an address book and faster shipment setup. FedEx Ship Manager Lite
















                        
                        
	                        What's the difference between a business account and personal account?

							
								

  Created with Sketch.














Both personal and business accounts receive discounts, an address book and faster shipment set up. A business account is recommended if youre selling a product or service, even if youre a sole proprietor. It has the added benefit of My FedEx Rewards  a free loyalty program that lets you earn exclusive perks when you use eligible shipping and printing services. In addition, youll get extra discounts on applicable FedEx Office services.
















                        
                        
	                        Will I be charged if I create a label but don't actually ship my package?

							
								

  Created with Sketch.














No, your FedEx account only gets charged once the FedEx agent scans the shipping label. You do not get charged if you create a shipping label, but don't actually ship the product.
















                        
                        
	                        Do shipping labels expire?

							
								

  Created with Sketch.














As long as the account that created the label is in good standing, the print return label does not have an expiration date. Email return labels may be set to be accessible for a maximum of two years from the date of the request for U.S. domestic shipments, including FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. Once the email return label has been printed (like the print return label), it never expires for use, as long as the account that created the label is in good standing.
















                        
                        
	                        Do I have to use FedEx packaging?

							
								

  Created with Sketch.














The only time you have to use FedEx packaging is when you use FedEx One Rate. Otherwise, you can use any sturdy, undamaged packaging for your shipments. If youre reusing a box, just make sure any old addresses and barcodes are completely covered.You can get more packaging tips and order free FedEx supplies by clicking the link below.
